PX021601,Waist Circumference - Waist Circumference NHANES,"Waist circumference is measured at several body sites in the scientific literature. For the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the measurement of the participant's abdominal (waist) circumference is made at the uppermost lateral border of the ilium using a tape measure. This measurement protocol was developed specifically for NHANES III (1988-1994) to improve reliability by standardizing the bony landmarks needed to determine the plane for measurement, and it is rarely used outside of the United States. In both children and adults, and compared with measurements taken using other protocols, measurements taken over the iliac crest tend to be several centimeters larger than measurements taken midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest (Protocol 021601) or at the level of the umbilicus (Protocol 021603), except when waist circumference is measured at the level of the umbilicus in an obese participant and the umbilicus has been displaced downward (i.e., pendulous abdomen). This protocol is recommended for use by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to define central obesity (greater than 102 cm in men; greater than 88 cm in women), and references by race/ethnicity have been developed for children and adolescents. It should not be used to calculate a waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) because it will overestimate the prevalence in the abnormal range (WHtR greater than 0.5). The relationship of this measure with cardiometabolic risk factors is, however, comparable with waist circumference measures taken at other sites. NOTE: Waist circumference can be measured on pregnant women. However, national reference data do not include pregnant women, and waist circumference has different associations with abdominal and total body fat among those who are not pregnant.",PhenX,RELEASED,,,PX021601,,

PX220704,Disease Progression and Regression - Adult,"The Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) can be used to evaluate the progression of mitochondrial disease. There are three versions of the NPMDS, each for a specific age range (0-24 months, 2-11 years, and 12-18 years). The NMDAS is for adult patients over 16 years. The investigators from Newcastle University recommend that if the child experiences early onset of a mitochondrial disease in childhood, the NPMDS 12-18 year scale should be used. If an adolescent experiences onset of a mitochondrial disease, the investigators recommend switching to the NMDAS scale at 16 years. The aim of the scales is to allow for standardization of patient assessment and to improve accurate data collection. The scales are composed of multiple domains: Current Function, System Specific Involvement, Current Clinical Assessment, and Quality of Life. Almost all questions provide a score which ranges from 0-3, with the following representations: 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe. Examples of the severity for each question are provided. Depending on the domain, the questions are either self- or interviewer-administrated, based on a provider's clinical assessment or medical records.
