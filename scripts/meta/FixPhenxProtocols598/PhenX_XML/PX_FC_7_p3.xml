        <questionText>The Tooth Surface Index of Fluorosis (TSIF) assesses dental fluorosis for each tooth surface. To obtain the Tooth Surface Index of Fluorosis (TSIF), each fully erupted, unrestored tooth surface is examined and assigned a score on a 0 to 7 scale noted below. This score is assigned to the posterior tooth Upper Right 3M from the buccal aspect.</questionText>

To obtain the Tooth Surface Index of Fluorosis (TSIF), each fully erupted, unrestored tooth surface is examined and assigned a score on a 0 to 7 scale noted below. This score is assigned to the posterior tooth Upper Right 1M from the buccal aspect.</questionText>

        <questionText>The Tooth Surface Index of Fluorosis (TSIF) assesses dental fluorosis for each tooth surface. To obtain the Tooth Surface Index of Fluorosis (TSIF), each fully erupted, unrestored tooth surface is examined and assigned a score on a 0 to 7 scale noted below. This score is assigned to the posterior tooth Upper Left 2B from the lingual aspect.</questionText>
