    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating ScaleÂ© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Current version of the C-SSRS assesses during predefined time periods-ideation in past 6 months and suicidal behavior over the adolescent's lifetime. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Actual Attempt:  A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. (actual_attempt)</questionText>

Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge.

     <shortName>PX640101</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale(C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Current version of the C-SSRS assesses during predefined time periods-ideation in past 6 months and suicidal behavior over the adolescent's lifetime. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>
