    <preferredDefinition>Hand grip strength is measured with a device called a hand-held dynamometer. The technician follows a script and asks the participant about hand surgery or pain that may influence the results. The technician asks the participant to sit in a chair and rest his/her arm on the table with the elbow on top of a mouse pad and arm held at a right angle. The technician adjusts the grip size of the dynamometer to the participant's hand size and explains how the device works. The participant stands for the measures if possible. The participant squeezes the dynamometer twice during practice trials. Now, starting with the right hand, the participant is asked to squeeze as hard as possible. Three trials are attempted with each hand, with all results recorded on a form. The sum of the greatest effort (number) for each hand is the measurement used. Results should be recorded to the nearest 2 kilograms.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Figure 4. Positioning the dynamometer for calibration 9. When you are ready to begin hanging the weights on the dynamometer handle, ask someone to assist you. The other person will need to keep the hanging base from moving as you add the weights to it. When picking up a weight, grab it by the indentation located on each side of the weight (Figure 5). NOTE: The person holding the hanging bases in place should be careful not to pull down on the base. The dynamometer reading only goes up. Pulling down on the hanging base can give you a false reading. (img_muscle_strength_6and7)</questionText>

The base weighs 1 kg however, it is too light to register on display. 11. Carefully and gently add a 10 kg slotted weight to the base through the side of the sitting box. The stem of the base should be flush with the back of the weight's slot (Figure 6). Ensure that the slot is centered on the stem of the base. The position of the weight will affect the reading.

        <questionText>Figure 7. Weights hanging from the dynamometer handle  13. The reading must fall between 9-13 kg. This is ± 2 kg of the slotted weight (10 kg) plus the weight of the base (1 kg).  If the reading falls within the range, record it. If the reading does not fall within the range, follow the troubleshooting tips. 14. After recording the reading, add another 10 kg slotted weight to the stem by following the procedures in steps 10 and 11. There will be a total of 2 1 kg weights hanging from the dynamometer. The second reading should fall within the range of 19-23 kg If the measurement falls within the range, record the reading. If the reading does not fall within the range, follow the troubleshooting tips. 15. After recording the second reading, add two more 10 kg weights to the base in the same manner indicated in steps 10 and 11. There will now be a total of 41 kgs of weight hanging from the dynamometer. The third reading should fall within the range of 39-43 kg. If the measurement falls within the range, record the reading. If the reading does not fall within the range, follow the troubleshooting tips. 16. After recording the final reading, carefully remove the slotted weights and the base from the handle and turn the dynamometer off. Do not leave the weights hanging from the handle any longer than absolutely necessary.  17. Calibrate the back-up dynamometer in the same manner (steps 4-16). When recording the readings for the back-up dynamometer, write the date of calibration and the serial number of the dynamometer somewhere on the paper.  18. Store all calibration items. (Put the calibration weights back in the cardboard boxes before storing them.)  19. Turn the sitting box over and return it to its proper place.  20. Enter the calibration readings for the dynamometer that will be used during the stand into ISIS.  21. Put the calibration readings for the back-up dynamometer in the carrying case with the back-up dynamometer and store it in the cabi..TRUNCATED(desc5)</questionText>

        <questionText>If any measurements for any weights are outside of the tolerance range, take all the weights off the handle and turn the dynamometer off. Turn the dynamometer back on, perform the procedure again for that weight, and verify if the result is in the acceptable range. Check the positioning of the slotted weight on the base. The stem of the base should be flush with the back of the weight's slot and centered. The position of the weight will affect the reading. If the result is still outside of the acceptable range, take all the weights off the handle, turn the dynamometer off, and then notify the team leader. If the team leader cannot get the reading within its acceptable range, calibrate and use the backup dynamometer. A dynamometer cannot be used if it does not calibrate properly.

        <questionText>Once all of the pretest questions have been completed, prepare the SP for the test. The SP will remain seated during the preparation and warmup.Ask the SP to remove hand and wrist jewelry. Hand and wrist jewelry could interfere with the SP's ability to grip the dynamometer or become damaged from squeezing the dynamometer. To prevent damaging the SP's jewelry, ask the SP to remove hand and wrist jewelry and place it in the small plastic container on the counter. If the SP does not want to remove his or her jewelry, the test will still continue.To loosen up the hands and fingers, the SP will complete two warmup exercises. The warmup exercises include shaking both hands three times and bending and stretching all fingers three times.

        <questionText>Figure 12. Checking angle of index finger  If the second joint of the SP's index finger cannot bend enough to achieve the 90 degree angle for any reason (i.e., arthritis, long nails, large or small hand), adjust the grip size to be as close to the 90 degree angle as you can and proceed with the exam. On the pretest screen, indicate whether or not the SP was able to bend his or her index finger to achieve the 90 degree angle  If the SP was not able to achieve a 90 degree angle at the second joint of the index finger, specify the hand (right, left, or both) in the drop-down box and enter the reason why in the "Comments" field (i.e., both hands too small, both hands too large, R arthritis, L nails too long). Record any additional comments regarding the SP's hand or fingers in the "Comments" field (Exhibits 3-4). Use the following abbreviations to record your comments: - -R: right hand - use capitalized letter "R" to refer to the right hand - L: left hand - use capitalized letter "L" to refer to the left hand- D: digit - use 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, and 5D to refer thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and pinky, respectively - P: phalange  For example, "missing 1P in L2D" means "missing 1 phalange in the index finger on left hand." After the grip size is adjusted for the first test hand, put the dynamometer in the opposite hand in the same manner. This will be the practice hand. Check the grip to see if the same grip size fits both hands. Most of the time, the grip size will be the same for both hands. If the grip size is not the same for both hands, follow the guidelines below to make adjustments: Use the wet erase pen to mark the placement of the handle for the first hand. The mark should be made on the back of the dynamometer inline with the indicator mark on the handle (Figure 13). Adjust the grip size for the second hand (the practice hand). Mark the handle placement for the second hand. Proceed with the demonstration. Make ..TRUNCATED(img_muscle_strength_16)</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 13. Proper marking of the handle placement The SP will only perform the exam in the seated position if he or she cannot stand unassisted (see section for individuals who cannot stand unassisted). Record if the SP will stand or sit for the exam on the pretest screen. If the exam will be completed in a sitting position, the system will prompt you to indicate whether either of the SP's feet can apply force to the ground. If it is not obvious, check the SP's leg function by placing your hand under the SP's foot/feet and ask the SP to apply force to your hand. The test will still continue regardless of the SP's leg function; however, this information is important for data analysis. Tech Demonstration of Exam After the grip size is adjusted, take the dynamometer from the SP and explain the exam to the SP using the suggested scripts below. During the demonstration, the SP can remain sitting while you stand to demonstrate. SUGGESTED SCRIPT:  For the test, I will ask you to squeeze this hand grip as hard as you can. You will stand with your feet hip width apart and your toes pointing forward like this. You will hold your hand so that it's not touching your body and squeeze the handle. I want you to stand tall and try not to lean when you squeeze. You will take a breath in, then blow out while you squeeze. You will squeeze as hard as you can until you can't squeeze any harder. Like this. (Do the squeeze demo now.) We will test each hand 3 times. While explaining the test to the SP, demonstrate the test as indicated below. - Grasp the dynamometer between the fingers and the palm at the base of the thumb. - Hold the dynamometer in line with the forearm at the thigh level so that it's not touching the body. - Emphasize that the SP should stand with the feet hip width apart with toes pointing forward. - Instruct the SP that neither the hand nor dynamometer should touch the body or any other object during the test. - Instruct the SP not..TRUNCATED(img_muscle_strength_17)</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 15. Arm position for seated exam  Start the Exam After the practice trial is completed and the SP understands the test, you are ready to begin the exam. For the exam, each hand will be tested three times, alternating hands between trials with a 60second rest between measurements on the same hand. The order of the tests is randomized by the SP's ID number and the SP's dominant hand (i.e., odd number ID starts with his or her dominant hand even number ID starts with his or her nondominant hand people with unidentifiable dominant hand randomly assigned by ID). Always double check the testing position before each test. SPs often move their feet between each test so it is important to double check the SP's feet each time. Press the "ON/C" button (Figure 16) on the dynamometer before the start of each test. This will reset the dynamometer reading to zero and disable the dynamometer from calculating and display the average grip strength reading automatically. For each test, once the SP finishes squeezing, take the dynamometer from the SP and enter the reading into the computer application. The 60second timer on the screen will start to countdown. Do not return the dynamometer to the SP until all 60 seconds have elapsed. Remember to set the dynamometer to zero by pressing the "ON/C" button prior to returning it to the SP (img_muscle_strength_19)</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 16. Dynamometer "ON/C" button    Reminder: If the SP's grip size was different between their two hands, you will need to adjust the handle size each time based on the marks you made earlier.  Coaching the SP When the SP is squeezing the dynamometer, encourage him or her by using a neutral, instructive, and upbeat tone. The SP will squeeze the dynamometer as hard as possible. Instruct the SP by saying: Suggested Script: When I say "squeeze," squeeze as hard as you can until you can't squeeze any harder. Remember to blow out when you squeeze.READY, TAKE A BREATH IN, LET IT OUT, SQUEEZE!SQUEEZE AS HARD AS YOU CAN UNTIL YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE ANY HARDER.After the first squeeze, do not repeat the entire coaching script unless it is necessary. For subsequent squeezes, say:READY, TAKE A BREATH IN, LET IT OUT, SQUEEZE  SQUEEZE AS HARD AS YOU CAN UNTIL YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE ANY HARDER. SPs may have different coaching needs. It is acceptable to adjust your coaching accordingly. For example, if the SP is holding his or her breath or starting to lean while squeezing, you may need to remind the SP to breathe out or to stand tall. Record the results into the data collection instrument. Remove batteries from dynamometers when finished for the day. Unusual Testing Situations  If an SP cannot stand up completely straight (i.e., osteoporosis), the exam will continue if this is normal for the SP. The SP will stand as straight as possible. If the SP bends or twists his or her body while squeezing the dynamometer (Figure 17), do not record the results. Illustrate again the proper position to the SP and repeat the measurement. If this is the first test of the exam, change the starting hand field and start the exam on the other hand. Use the digital timer to make sure you wait 60 seconds before testing the hand again. If this is not the first test, move on and test the opposite hand, then come back and repeat the measurement. It is important to wait 60 ..TRUNCATED(img_muscle_strength_20)</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 17. Positioning mistakes  Some SPs may experience pain due to arthritis or tendonitis when squeezing the dynamometer. Make sure the pain is not caused by inappropriate grip size or grip position. Encourage the SP to complete the exam. Grip strength test is a common functional assessment that is routinely used in clinical setting for arthritis, tendonitis, or carpal tunnel syndrome patients. There should be no more than minimal risk associated with the grip test. If the SP experiences pain when squeezing the dynamometer and cannot continue the test, stop the test on that hand. If the dynamometer is dropped, swap it out for another dynamometer. (dec10_150302)</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>Hand grip strength is measured with a device called a hand-held dynamometer. The technician follows a script and asks the participant about hand surgery or pain that may influence the results. The technician asks the participant to sit in a chair and rest his/her arm on the table with the elbow on top of a mouse pad and arm held at a right angle. The technician adjusts the grip size of the dynamometer to the participant's hand size and explains how the device works. The participant stands for the measures if possible. The participant squeezes the dynamometer twice during practice trials. Now, starting with the right hand, the participant is asked to squeeze as hard as possible. Three trials are attempted with each hand, with all results recorded on a form. The sum of the greatest effort (number) for each hand is the measurement used. Results should be recorded to the nearest 2 kilograms.</preferredDefinition>
