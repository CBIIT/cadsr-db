scoring_instruct_200302,phenx_early_childhood_speech_and_language_assessment_speech,,descriptive,"Scoring Instructions:

Composite scale scores are calculated by adding together the ratings for the items in each subscale and dividing by the total number of items in that scale.

Assertiveness subscale: items 1, 11, 12
Responsiveness subscale: items 2, 13
Semantics subscale: items 5, 6, 10
Syntax subscale: items 14, 15
Articulation subscale: items 4, 7, 16
Assertiveness and responsiveness measure the use of language in social contexts. Semantics measures word learning. Syntax measures grammar. Articulation measures speech sound production and intelligibility.

Detailed instructions on scoring and interpretation can be found in Hadley and Rice (1993).",,PX200302,,,,,,,,,,
