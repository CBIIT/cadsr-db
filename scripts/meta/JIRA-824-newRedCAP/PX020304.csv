desc1_20304,phenx_body_composition_subscapular_skinfold_thickness,,descriptive,"Subscapular Skinfold: The subscapular skinfold is measured at the inferior angle of the right scapula. Instructions for performing the subscapular skinfold measure are provided below:

1. Position the participant: Similar to the triceps skinfold measure, turn the participant so that you stand behind his or her right side. Have the participant stand upright with weight evenly distributed on both feet, shoulders relaxed, and arms hanging loosely at the sides.

2. Mark the measurement site: Tell the participant that you are going to open the gown in the back and mark the skin with the cosmetic pencil. Open the back of the gown and palpate for the inferior angle, or triangle portion, of the right scapula (Exhibit 6). Using the cosmetic pencil, mark a cross (X) on the inferior angle (Exhibit 7). Make the first line at 45º to the spine and cross this with a line that bisects the inferior angle of the scapula.

3. Grasp the skinfold: Using your thumb and index finger, grasp a fold so that the index finger remains situated roughly 2.0 cm above and medial to the inferior angle of the scapula. Due to tightness in this area of the back on many participants, obtaining this skinfold measure can be a challenge. In the cases where you experience difficulty separating the subscapular skinfold from the underlying tissue, begin grasping the fold with the thumb and index finger spread wide.

4. Position the caliper: Continue to hold the skinfold in place. With the other hand, set the top jaw of the caliper on the ""+"" mark. This differs from the triceps skinfold procedure in which the mark is centered between the caliper tips. Position the tips of the caliper jaws over the complete skinfold perpendicular to the length of the fold and roughly 2.0 cm lateral to the fingers (Exhibit 8).

5. Take the measurement: Continue to hold the skinfold in place and release the caliper handle to exert full tension on the skinfold. Wait 3 seconds for the needle on the caliper dial to settle on an accurate measurement. Read the thickness to the nearest 0.2 mm.

6. Record the result. Remove the caliper jaws first and then let go of the skinfold.
