Grocery stores include establishments generally known as supermarkets and smaller grocery stores primarily engaged in retailing a general line of food, such as canned and frozen foods; fresh fruits and vegetables; and fresh and prepared meats, fish, and poultry.</p><p>Fast Food Restaurants - The number of limited-service restaurants in the county. Limited-service restaurants include establishments primarily engaged in providing food services where patrons generally order or select items and pay before eating. Food and drink may be consumed on premises, taken out, or delivered to the customer&rsquo;s location.</p><p>Convenience Stores/Food Marts - The number of convenience stores in the county. Establishments known as convenience stores or food marts are primarily engaged in retailing a limited line of goods that include soda, snack foods, etc.</p><p>Calculating the Traditional Retail Food Environment Index</p><p>After downloading the data for a given county, the traditional Retail Food Environment Index may then be calculated as follows:</p><p>Traditional Retail Food Environment Index (RFEI) =</p><p>(Fast Food / Limited Service Establishments + Convenience Stores) / (Grocery Stores / Super Markets)</p><p>Additional information may be found in the related publication at: <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijerph14111366"">https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijerph14111366</a></span><a name=""_Hlt35010764""><a name=""_Hlt30582536""></a><span> </span></a></p><p>The RFEI can be categorized as following:</p><p>800 m buffer:</p><p>below 3.0</p><p>3.0 &ndash; 4.9</p><p>5.0 and above</p><p>1600 m buffer</p><p>below 6.0</p><p>6.0 &ndash; 9.9</p><p>10.0 and above</p><p>The number indicates the times greater of unhealthy food access (i.e. a RFEI of 3 indicates there are 3 times more unhealthy food retailers vs healthy food retailers in a given radius). A higher RFEI has been correlated with a higher obesity rate compared to a lower RFEI.  </p>",,PX290501,,,,,,,,,,
