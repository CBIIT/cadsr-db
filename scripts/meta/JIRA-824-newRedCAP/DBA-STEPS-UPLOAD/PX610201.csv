scoring_610201,phenx_broad_psychopathology_adult,,descriptive,"Scoring and Interpretation. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0 = none or not at all; 1 = slight or rare, less than a day or two; 2 = mild or several days; 3 = moderate or more than half the days; and 4 = severe or nearly every day). The score on each item within a domain should be reviewed. Because additional inquiry is based on the highest score on any item within a domain, the clinician is asked to indicate that score in the ""Highest Domain Score"" column. A rating of mild (i.e., 2) or greater on any item within a domain (except for substance use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis) may serve as a guide for additional inquiry and follow-up to determine if a more detailed assessment for that domain is necessary. For substance use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis, a rating of slight (i.e., 1) or greater on any item within the domain may serve as a guide for additional inquiry and follow-up to determine if a more detailed assessment is needed. The DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures may be used to provide more detailed information on the symptoms associated with some of the Level 1 domains (see Table 1 below).",,PX0610201,,,,,,,,,,
