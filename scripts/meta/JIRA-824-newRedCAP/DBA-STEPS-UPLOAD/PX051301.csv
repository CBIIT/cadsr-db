info_51301,phenx_iodine,,descriptive,"1. Specimen Collection, Storage, and Handling Procedures; Criteria for Specimen Rejection. A. Urine specimen should be collected in a urine specimen container that is sterile and prescreened for trace iodine contamination. The optimal amount of specimen required is more than 1.8 mL, minimum volume required for analysis is about 0.8 mL. B. Specimens should be frozen at ?20°C until analysis. Specimen stability has been demonstrated for 1 year at -20°C. C. The criteria for unacceptable specimens are either a low volume (< 0.8 mL) or suspected contamination due to improper collection procedures or collection devices. In all cases, a second specimen should be requested. D. Specimen characteristics that may compromise test results include contamination of urine by contact with dust, dirt, etc. from improper handling. E. In general, urine specimens should be transported and stored at -20°C. Once received, they can be frozen at -20°C for up to 1 year until analysis. Portions of the sample that remain after analytical aliquots are withdrawn and should be refrozen at -20°C. Samples thawed and refrozen several times are not compromised.",,PX051301,,,,,,,,,,
