A digital scale or beam balance is used to weigh participants.

Participants are asked to wear an examination gown and socks or light clothes without shoes. Only undergarments are worn beneath the gown. Infants should wear a clean diaper and t-shirt if they have not been placed in an examination gown. The procedures for obtaining the weight measurement are as follows:

The examiner briefly informs the participant that his/her weight will be measured. Participants are asked to remove objects such as cell phones, wallets, and toys from their pockets.

1. The health technician directs participants to stand in the center of the scale platform with hands at their sides and looking straight ahead.

2. The weight measurement is recorded in kilograms or pounds.

3. Special situations:

Small children: Infants and toddlers who cannot stand alone on the scale will be weighed with an adult, with an infant's scale. If an adult is holding the child, then the adult guardian or the health technician will stand alone on the scale so the scale can be tared. This sets the scale readout to zero. The child is then handed to the adult and the child's weight is measured.

If the participant is wearing a cast or medical prosthesis, make a note in the record of the location and place.

If the participant wore street clothes instead of the examination gown, make a note of this in the record. It is acceptable for infants to wear diapers or underpants and a t-shirt.

Participants should not be weighed if they are wearing shoes.

Note that special consideration may be needed for participants whose weight exceeds the capacity of the study scale. For example, weight can be obtained using two portable scales:

Have the participant stand with one foot on each portable scale.

Combine the two results to approximate the weight.

Record the weight.

If the weight equals the capacity of both portable scales, note that the weight Equals Capacity (EC) of the scales.
