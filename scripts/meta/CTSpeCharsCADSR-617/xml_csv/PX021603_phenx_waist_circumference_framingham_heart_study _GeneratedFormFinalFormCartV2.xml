   <longName> Waist Circumference Framingham Heart Study</longName>
   <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
   <preferredDefinition>Waist circumference is measured at several body sites in the scientific literature. This protocol is from the Framingham Heart Study in which measurement of the participant&apos;s waist circumference is performed at the level of the umbilicus (i.e., navel or &quot;belly button&quot;). Although this protocol is still used in surveys and studies, care should be taken in using it because it does not rely on reliable bony landmarks and is biased by degree of abdominal obesity. On the other hand, unlike the protocols that require palpation for bony landmarks (which may be problematic with some populations), an umbilicus is visualized or can be located through thin clothing. In both children and adults and compared with measurements taken using other protocols, measurements taken at the level of the umbilicus tend to be roughly comparable with those taken midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest (NCFS protocol) if the participants are at a normal weight, but measurements tend to be more comparable with or even larger than those taken over the iliac crest (NHANES protocol) when the participant is obese and the umbilicus has been displaced downward (i.e., pendulous abdomen). The relationship of this measure with cardiometabolic risk factors is, however, comparable with waist circumference measures taken at other sites. NOTE: Waist circumference can be measured on pregnant women. However, national reference data do not include pregnant women, and waist circumference has different associations with abdominal and total body fat among those who are not pregnant.</preferredDefinition>

       <questionText>With the subject standing upright with feet together, arms hanging loosely at sides, and weight evenly distributed, did the examiner take the subject&apos;s hospital gown from the back, place it over the shoulder, place the anthropometric tape at the level of the umbilicus, applying the tape snugly but not tightly, making sure the tape was on a horizontal plane and ask the patient to fully relax their shoulders before taking measurement? </questionText>
