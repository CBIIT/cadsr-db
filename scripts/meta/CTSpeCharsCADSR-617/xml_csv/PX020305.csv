desc1_20305,phenx_body_composition_suprailiac_skinfold_thickness,,descriptive,Suprailiac Skinfold:The participant stands and holds the right side of the exam gown up so that the right hip area is exposed. It may be necessary to lower the exam pants slightly to expose the area. The examiner stands behind the participant and palpates the hip area for the right iliac crest. The examiner marks a horizontal line at the high point of the iliac crest and then crosses the line to indicate the midaxillary. The examiner places his/her thumb (left) on the intersecting marks and picks up the skinfold with the thumb and fingers. The skinfold should slope downward and forward at a 45  angle extending toward the pubic symphysis (see Exhibit 1). The caliper is placed perpendicular to the skinfold about 2.0 cm medial to the fingers and the skinfold is measured to the nearest 0.2 mm,,PX020305,,,,,,,,,,
