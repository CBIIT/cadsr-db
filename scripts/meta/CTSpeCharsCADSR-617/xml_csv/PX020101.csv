This protocol is part of an examination survey. It requires a tape measure at least 2 m long, a flat surface (usually a wall), and an adjustable block that is fixed to the wall. The spool of the tape measure is fixed to the adjustable block. The block serves as the contact point for the middle (longest) finger of the right hand, which is in contact with the block when the participant is positioned. The block must be movable so that it can be adjusted vertically to accommodate individuals of varying stature. The block is adjusted to bring the tape to the shoulder level for the subject, and then the tape is pulled horizontally along the wall. The participant stands with the feet together so that his or her back is against the wall. The arms are outstretched laterally and maximally at the level of the shoulders, in contact with the wall, and with the palms facing forward. The tip of the middle (longest) finger (excluding the fingernail) of the right hand is kept in contact with the block, while the zero end of the tape is set at the tip of the middle (longest) finger (excluding the fingernail) of the left hand. Two people (measurers) are necessary, one at the zero end of the tape to be sure the tape end is positioned correctly and the other at the block end to make the reading. The measurement is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm (1/4""). Occasionally, a small stool may be required for the measurers to make this measurement on tall subjects (when the measurer is shorter than the study subject).

 When making this measurement, it is imperative that the participant's arms be outstretched maximally and that they are held in this position until the reading is taken. Special care must be taken with young children and older individuals as they tend to lower their arms during the measurement.

 * Please note that there might be high levels of participant discomfort (see Burden Table) for the elderly and young children who may not be as flexible.",text,"Arm Span measured in centimeter, first measurement.",,PX020101,number,1,200,,,,,,,
