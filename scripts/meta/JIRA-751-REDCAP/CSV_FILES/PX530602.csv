memory_task_correct_detections,phenx_motor_and_attentional_impulsivity_immediate_and_delayed,,text,A target stimulus is a 5-digit number that is identical to the preceding number. Responses to target stimuli are recorded as correct detections. How many correct detections were made by the participant?,,PX530602,number,,,,,,,,,
memory_task_filler_errors,phenx_motor_and_attentional_impulsivity_immediate_and_delayed,,text,A filler stimulus is a random 5-digit number that appears whenever a target or catch trial is not scheduled to appear.
