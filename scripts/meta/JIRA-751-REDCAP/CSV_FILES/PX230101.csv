intro_230101,phenx_eating_disorders_examination_child_interview,,descriptive,"1. INTRODUCTION: The idea is to get a general picture of the subjects eating habits. It is very difficult for children to get a clear grasp of the time span being discussed. Hopefully, we will have an agenda for the last three months that has been completed by the child's parent. At this point, ask the child if they think that the agenda is accurate, and if there were any other significant events that occurred over the last three months that they would like to add to the agenda. The child then keeps this agenda on which all this information is written throughout the interview and should be encouraged to refer to it.Having used this agenda to orient the child to the specific time period being assessed, use the following questions as guidelines to ascertain the child's general eating habits.*To start with I'd like to get an idea of how your eating has been over the last four weeks.",,PX0230101,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, on these items, they cannot be marked for these behaviors. However, when it becomes clearer later on that these are their main concerns and therefore prime motivation for engaging in a particular behavior - Fairburn suggests that you can go back and re-rate, although he may not have had such core concepts in mind",,PX0230101,,,,,,,,,,

In the pilot study, this was often not convincing (although not exactly lying) but had to be rated as child answered, and hence some scores may be consistently underrating the child's psychopathology.",,PX0230101,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to note that the forms of overeating are not mutually exclusive: it is possible for subjects to have had several different forms of overeating episodes over the preceding month.Definition of key terms: Loss of control: The interviewer should ask the subject whether he or she experienced a loss of control over eating at the time that the episode of overeating occurred. * If this is clearly described, loss of control should be rated as present. * Loss of control may be rated positively even if the episode has been planned. * If the subject uses terms such as ""driven to eat"" etc., loss of control should be rated as present. For chronic cases only:  * If the subject reports no sense of loss of control, yet describes having not been able to stop eating once eating had started, or having not been able to prevent the episode from occurring, loss of control should be rated as present. * If the subjects report that they are no longer trying to control their eating because overeating is inevitable, loss of control should be rated as present. If the interviewer is in doubt, loss of control should be rated as absent. * Large amount of food. The decision whether or not the amount eaten was ""large"" should be made by the interviewer and should not require the agreement of the subject. * ""Large"" may be used to refer to the amount of any particular types or the overall quantity of food consumed. * The interviewer should take into account what would be the usual amount eaten under the circumstances. This required some knowledge of the eating habits of the subject's general (but not necessarily immediate) social group. * What else was eaten and whether or not the subject subsequently spits or vomits the food. If the interviewer is in doubt, the amount should not be classified as large.  The number of episodes of overeating. When calculating the number of episodes of overeating, the subject's definition of separate episodes should be accepted unless there was an hour or more within a period of eating when the subject was not eating. * In this case, the initial episode should be regarded as having been completed. *When estimating the length of any gap, do not count the time spent vomiting.  * Note that purging (self induced vomiting or laxative misuse) is not used to define the end of an individual episode of overeating.  Guidelines for rating the overeating section. 1. Ask the questions in order to identify the episodes of perceived or true overeating have occurred over the previous 28 days. Note down all the forms of overeating.
2. Obtain detailed information about each form of overeating to decide whether it involved eating ""large"" amounts of food and whether or not there was a ""loss of control"".  3. Then establish, for each form of overeating, the number of days on which it occurred and the total number of occasions. It is advisable to make comprehensive notes. 4. Finally, check with the subject to ensure that no misunderstandings have arisen.",,PX0230101,,,,,,,,,,
