        <questionText>Venipuncture Procedures: Please review chapter 4 of the Laboratory Procedures Manual from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2008 for a full description of phlebotomy procedures: 2007-2008 NHANES laboratory procedures manual .Venipuncture should generally be performed using the median cubital, cephalic, or basilic veins in the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable veins on the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look for veins in the forearm or dorsal side of the hand on the left arm/hand and then the right arm/hand. Note from the Gastrointestinal Working Group: Blood should be collected in an appropriate 5- or 10-mL red-top tube. (venip_proc_liver)</questionText>

    <longName>PhenX PX220704 - Disease Progression And Regression Adult</longName>
    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) can be used to evaluate the progression of mitochondrial disease. There are three versions of the NPMDS, each for a specific age range (0-24 months, 2-11 years, and 12-18 years). The NMDAS is for adult patients over 16 years. The investigators from Newcastle University recommend that if the child experiences early onset of a mitochondrial disease in childhood, the NPMDS 12-18 year scale should be used. If an adolescent experiences onset of a mitochondrial disease, the investigators recommend switching to the NMDAS scale at 16 years. The aim of the scales is to allow for standardization of patient assessment and to improve accurate data collection. The scales are composed of multiple domains: Current Function, System Specific Involvement, Current Clinical Assessment, and Quality of Life. Almost all questions provide a score which ranges from 0-3, with the following representations: 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe. Examples of the severity for each question are provided. Depending on the domain, the questions are either self- or interviewer-administrated, based on a provider’s clinical assessment or medical records. There is a manual for each scale, which details the administration, process, and scoring instructions.</preferredDefinition>

     <shortName>PX220704</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>The Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) can be used to evaluate the progression of mitochondrial disease. There are three versions of the NPMDS, each for a specific age range (0-24 months, 2-11 years, and 12-18 years). The NMDAS is for adult patients over 16 years. The investigators from Newcastle University recommend that if the child experiences early onset of a mitochondrial disease in childhood, the NPMDS 12-18 year scale should be used. If an adolescent experiences onset of a mitochondrial disease, the investigators recommend switching to the NMDAS scale at 16 years. The aim of the scales is to allow for standardization of patient assessment and to improve accurate data collection. The scales are composed of multiple domains: Current Function, System Specific Involvement, Current Clinical Assessment, and Quality of Life. Almost all questions provide a score which ranges from 0-3, with the following representations: 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe. Examples of the severity for each question are provided. Depending on the domain, the questions are either self- or interviewer-administrated, based on a provider’s clinical assessment or medical records. There is a manual for each scale, which details the administration, process, and scoring instructions.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Recovery Self-Assessment (RSA) family member/significant other version is a 40-item, proxy-administered rating scale that focuses on perceptions of recovery principles and overall quality of services, including determination, staff helpfulness, and staff responsiveness. The RSA includes six subscales: life goals, consumer involvement, and diversity of treatment options, consumer choice, individually tailored services, and inviting environment. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree; 5 = Strongly agree). Ratings from the individual items can be added together to yield a total score, with the higher scores indicating greater quality care.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Recovery Self-Assessment (RSA) family member/significant other version is a 40-item, proxy-administered rating scale that focuses on perceptions of recovery principles and overall quality of services, including determination, staff helpfulness, and staff responsiveness. The RSA includes six subscales: life goals, consumer involvement, and diversity of treatment options, consumer choice, individually tailored services, and inviting environment. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree; 5 = Strongly agree). Ratings from the individual items can be added together to yield a total score, with the higher scores indicating greater quality care.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) is a clinician-administered rating scale that includes four subscales and four Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) scales. The four subscales include drug-induced movement disorders (12-item questionnaire rated on a 4-point scale), parkinsonism and akathisia (7-item examination rated on a 7-point scale), dystonia (10-item examination rated on a 7-point scale), and dyskinesia (7-item examination rated on a 7-point scale). The four clinical global impression severity scales capture tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia and are rated according to the clinician&apos;s experience using an 8-point rating scale.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) is a clinician-administered rating scale that includes four subscales and four Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) scales. The four subscales include drug-induced movement disorders (12-item questionnaire rated on a 4-point scale), parkinsonism and akathisia (7-item examination rated on a 7-point scale), dystonia (10-item examination rated on a 7-point scale), and dyskinesia (7-item examination rated on a 7-point scale). The four clinical global impression severity scales capture tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia and are rated according to the clinician&apos;s experience using an 8-point rating scale.</preferredDefinition>
