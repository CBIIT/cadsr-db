A densitometer scanner device is used to scan the entire body or specific body sites such as the hip, spine, and limbs. DXA uses X-ray energy to measure body fat, muscle, and bone mineral and as a result, a small amount of radiation is delivered to the body during the DXA scan procedure. The results from a whole body DXA scan can be used to estimate total mass (gm), bone mineral content (BMC) (gm), bone area (cm<sup>2</sup>), bone mineral density, fat mass, lean mass excluding BMC (gm), lean mass including BMC (gm), and percent body fat (%). These measures can also be subdivided from the whole body to regional measures of the arms, legs, trunk, android, gynoid, and head. Furthermore, special algorithms have been created to estimate visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.

PX021601,Waist Circumference - Waist Circumference NHANES,"Waist circumference is measured at several body sites in the scientific literature. For the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the measurement of the participant's abdominal (waist) circumference is made at the uppermost lateral border of the ilium using a tape measure. This measurement protocol was developed specifically for NHANES III (1988-1994) to improve reliability by standardizing the bony landmarks needed to determine the plane for measurement, and it is rarely used outside of the United States. In both children and adults, and compared with measurements taken using other protocols, measurements taken over the iliac crest tend to be several centimeters larger than measurements taken midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest (Protocol 021601) or at the level of the umbilicus (Protocol 021603), except when waist circumference is measured at the level of the umbilicus in an obese participant and the umbilicus has been displaced downward (i.e., pendulous abdomen). This protocol is recommended for use by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to define central obesity (greater than 102 cm in men; greater than 88 cm in women), and references by race/ethnicity have been developed for children and adolescents. It should not be used to calculate a waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) because it will overestimate the prevalence in the abnormal range (WHtR greater than 0.5). The relationship of this measure with cardiometabolic risk factors is, however, comparable with waist circumference measures taken at other sites. NOTE: Waist circumference can be measured on pregnant women. However, national reference data do not include pregnant women, and waist circumference has different associations with abdominal and total body fat among those who are not pregnant. ",PhenX,RELEASED,NHANES: 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Study Anthropometry Procedures Manual,physical,PX021601,,
PX021602,Waist Circumference - Waist Circumference NCFS,"Waist circumference is measured at several body sites in the scientific literature. During the National Children's Food Survey, the participant's waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. This protocol is used most commonly for adults and children in European, Asian, and South American surveys and studies, and for children, several area- or country-specific references are available to define a 90th percentile cutoff, which is the main criterion for metabolic syndrome in children. This is important because there are ethnic-specific cutoffs for central (i.e., abdominal) obesity in adults using waist circumference, and it is presumed that comparable racial/ethnic differences exist for children and adolescents. In both children and adults, and compared with measurements taken using other protocols, measurements taken midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest tend to be several centimeters smaller than measurements taken over the iliac crest (NHANES protocol). It is more comparable with measurements taken at the level of the umbilicus (Framingham protocol), except when waist circumference is measured at the level of the umbilicus in an obese participant, and the umbilicus has been displaced downward (i.e., pendulous abdomen). This measurement can be used to calculate a waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) because it will accurately estimate the prevalence in the abnormal range (WHtR greater than 0.5). The relationship of this measure with cardiometabolic risk factors is also comparable with waist circumference measures taken at other sites.  NOTE: Waist circumference can be measured on pregnant women.

PX021603,Waist Circumference - Framingham Heart Study,"Waist circumference is measured at several body sites in the scientific literature. This protocol is from the Framingham Heart Study in which measurement of the participant's waist circumference is performed at the level of the umbilicus (i.e., navel or ""belly button""). Although this protocol is still used in surveys and studies, care should be taken in using it because it does not rely on reliable bony landmarks and is biased by degree of abdominal obesity. On the other hand, unlike the protocols that require palpation for bony landmarks (which may be problematic with some populations), an umbilicus is visualized or can be located through thin clothing. In both children and adults and compared with measurements taken using other protocols, measurements taken at the level of the umbilicus tend to be roughly comparable with those taken midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest (NCFS protocol) if the participants are at a normal weight, but measurements tend to be more comparable with or even larger than those taken over the iliac crest (NHANES protocol) when the participant is obese and the umbilicus has been displaced downward (i.e., pendulous abdomen). The relationship of this measure with cardiometabolic risk factors is, however, comparable with waist circumference measures taken at other sites.

A series of ""red flag"" or alarm symptom questions are included at the end of the questionnaire (questions 82 to 93). Although these are not part of the diagnostic criteria, they are helpful in determining whether other diagnostic studies are needed to exclude other conditions that may explain symptoms captured in this questionnaire. A positive answer to any of these questions suggests a possibility of a diagnosis other than functional gastrointestinal disorder. This questionnaire is intended for research and may be used to aid diagnosis. However, it is not meant as an instrument for self-diagnosis nor does it obviate the need for medical evaluation including history, physical examination, and limited laboratory and endoscopic testing of individual patients. The questionnaire is followed by a coding system that identifies provisional diagnoses from the responses to the questions. The presence of an ""alarm"" symptom does not negate a diagnosis of an FGID, but it may indicate further inquiry or testing to rule out other conditions/diseases. Similarly, an indication of psychosocial difficulties will not alter the diagnosis but should prompt health care professionals to collect more information and possibly offer appropriate treatment. In the absence of biological markers and confirmatory tests for FGIDs, their diagnosis depends on applying these criteria, performing limited testing, and judiciously excluding other conditions.",PhenX,RELEASED,,self,PX190101,,

In addition, the measure may be used to track changes in the individual's symptom presentation over time.  This adult version of the measure consists of 23 questions that assess 13 psychiatric domains, including depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. Each item inquires about how much (or how often) the individual has been bothered by the specific symptom during the past 2 weeks. If the individual is of impaired capacity and unable to complete the form (e.g., an individual with dementia), a knowledgeable adult informant may complete the measure. The measure was found to be clinically useful and to have good test-retest reliability in the DSM-5 Field Trials that were conducted in adult clinical samples across the United States and in Canada.  Frequency of Use To track change in the individual's symptom presentation over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual's symptoms and treatment status. For individuals with impaired capacity, it is preferable that the same knowledgeable informant completes the measures at follow-up appointments.

PX821201,Sustained and Selective Attention,"The Conners Continuous Performance Test 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition<sup>TM </sup>(Conners CPT 3&#8482;) is a computerized test for the assessment of visual attention problems in individuals' ages 8 years old and older. Respondents press the spacebar (or click the mouse) when any letter of the alphabet (except ""X"") appears on the screen. Commission errors occur when the spacebar is pressed when an ""X"" is presented. Omission errors occur when the spacebar is not pressed when a letter besides ""X"" is presented on the screen. Reaction time is the interval between the appearance of the letter on the screen and the response, e.g., pressing the spacebar. The Conners CPT 3&#8482; uses both standardized and raw scores to measure overall visual attention as well as specific aspects of attention in the areas of inattentiveness, impulsivity, sustained attention and vigilance.",PhenX,RELEASED,,comp_task,PX821201,,
