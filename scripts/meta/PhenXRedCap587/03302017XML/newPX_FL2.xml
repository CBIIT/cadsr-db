      <longName>This protocol is part of an examination survey. It requires a tape measure at least 2 m long, a flat surface (usually a wall), and an adjustable block that is fixed to the wall. The spool of the tape measure is fixed to the adjustable block. The block serves as the contact point for the middle (longest) finger of the right hand, which is in contact with the block when the participant is positioned. The block must be movable so that it can be adjusted vertically to accommodate individuals of varying stature. The block is adjusted to bring the tape to the shoulder level for the subject, and then the tape is pulled horizontally along the wall. The participant stands with the feet together so that his or her back is against the wall. The arms are outstretched laterally and maximally at the level of the shoulders, in contact with the wall, and with the palms facing forward. The tip of the middle (longest) finger (excluding the fingernail) of the right hand is kept in contact with the block, while the zero end of the tape is set at the tip of the middle (longest) finger (excluding the fingernail) of the left hand. Two people (measurers) are necessary, one at the zero end of the tape to be sure the tape end is positioned correctly and the other at the block end to make the reading. The measurement is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm (1/4"). Occasionally, a small stool may be required for the measurers to make this measurement on tall subjects (when the measurer is shorter than the study subject). When making this measurement, it is imperative that the participant's arms be outstretched maximally and that they are held in this position until the reading is taken. Special care must be taken with young children and older individuals as they tend to lower their arms during the measurement.* Please note that there might be high levels of participant discomfort (see Burden Table) for the elderly and young children who may not be as flexible.</longName>

      <longName>This protocol is for an examination study. Use calibrated infant scale for weighing infant. Naked weight of infant is preferred, but if the mother objects, wrap naked infant in study blanket for procedure. Record on form whether infant is weighed with a study blanket. Note: If the infant urinates in the blanket, repeat the measurement using a dry blanket.  Place the infant on the scale so that weight is distributed equally about the center of the pan. Record the weight on form. Remove the infant from the scale, then replace and weigh a second time. Record the second weight on form. If the difference in the two weights is greater than 100 grams, obtain a third measurement. Note the weight of the blanket and subtract the weight of the blanket from the total weight of the infant plus blanket to estimate birth weight of the infant.</longName>

    <preferredDefinition>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is one of the most widely used methods to assess body composition in a laboratory environment. A densitometer scanner device is used to scan the entire body or specific body sites such as the hip, spine, and limbs. DXA uses X-ray energy to measure body fat, muscle, and bone mineral and as a result, a small amount of radiation is delivered to the body during the DXA scan procedure. The results from a whole body DXA scan can be used to estimate total mass (gm), bone mineral content (BMC) (gm), bone area (cm 2 ), bone mineral density, fat mass, lean mass excluding BMC (gm), lean mass including BMC (gm), and percent body fat (%). These measures can also be subdivided from the whole body to regional measures of the arms, legs, trunk, android, gynoid, and head. Furthermore, special algorithms have been created to estimate visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.

        <questionText>A downloadable PDF of the full National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Body Composition Procedures Manual is available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_11_12/Body_Composition_Procedures_Manual.pdf The following is a summary version of the full NHANES protocol. There are several overarching, critical issues for highquality data collection of anthropometric measures which optimize the data in geneenvironment etiologic research. These issues include: (1) the need for training (and retraining) of study staff in anthropometric data collection (2) duplicate collection of measurements, especially under field conditions (3) use of more than one person for proper collection of measurements where required (4) accurate recording of the protocols and the measurement units of data collection and (5) use of required and properly calibrated equipment. NOTE: Dualenergy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement is not complex, but does require costly hardware, specialized software to analyze the DXA scans, rigorous quality control, certified examiners, and continuous equipment calibration and monitoring. Although excerpts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) protocol are provided for informational purposes, investigators should review all facets of the protocol prior to undertaking DXA examinations in a study. A detailed description of the NHANES protocol is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. The following excerpts from the NHANES 19992006 protocols refer to a specific make and model DXA scanner. Several brands of DXA scanners are available and manufacturerspecific software, calibration, and quality control practices should be followed. DXA Equipment: Several DXA densitometer devices are marketed commercially. The Hologic™ 4500A fan beam Xray bone densitometer was used in NHANES 19992009 protocol. In 2011, the NHANES systems were replaced with the Discovery/A sy..TRUNCATED</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is one of the most widely used methods to assess body composition in a laboratory environment. A densitometer scanner device is used to scan the entire body or specific body sites such as the hip, spine, and limbs. DXA uses X-ray energy to measure body fat, muscle, and bone mineral and as a result, a small amount of radiation is delivered to the body during the DXA scan procedure. The results from a whole body DXA scan can be used to estimate total mass (gm), bone mineral content (BMC) (gm), bone area (cm 2), bone mineral density, fat mass, lean mass excluding BMC (gm), lean mass including BMC (gm), and percent body fat (%). These measures can also be subdivided from the whole body to regional measures of the arms, legs, trunk, android, gynoid, and head. Furthermore, special algorithms have been created to estimate visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.

        <questionText>Recumbent length is measured on infants and children ages birth through 47 months of age in NHANES 200708. An infantometer device is used. The device has a fixed headpiece, horizontal backboard, and movable foot piece. If the child is not wearing an examination gown, ask the parent or guardian to remove the child's clothes except for a diaper or underpants and tshirt.Position the child on the infantometer with the feet positioned against the foot piece (Exhibit 1) and the head against the headpiece (Exhibit 2). Children often cry when placed on the infantometer, so ask the parent or guardian to stand between the examiner and recorder, make eye contact, and reassure the child</questionText>

        <questionText>One person supports the child's head and ensures that the head is positioned in the Frankfort horizontal plane. To do this, apply gentle traction to bring the top of the head in contact with the fixed headpiece. Secure the child's head in the proper alignment by lightly cupping the palms of your hands over the ears.A second person can align the child's legs by placing one hand gently but with mild pressure over the knees. With the other hand, slide the foot piece to rest firmly against the soles of the feet. The toes should point upward with both soles of the feet flexed perpendicular against the acrylic foot piece. To encourage the child to flex the feet, run the tip of your finger down the inside of the foot.NOTE: If you are unable to position both legs correctly, make certain that at least one leg is straight with the foot flexed against the foot piece so that a measurement can be made. The oneleg positioning is the exception rather than the rule and is only used when children are extremely agitated or uncooperative.</questionText>

        <questionText>Rated separately for each side  roband lies on examination bed, without sight of his legs. Proband is asked to lift one leg, point with the heel to the opposite knee, slide down along the shin to the ankle, and lay the leg back on the examination bed. The task is performed 3 times. Slidedown movements should be performed within 1 s. If proband slides down without contact to shin in all three trials, rate 'Unable to perform the task'.  Score Right:_____________</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) is a clinical scale used to assess cerebellar ataxia. The scale includes 8 items that are related to gait, stance, sitting, speech, finger-chase test, nose-finger test, fast alternating movements and heel-shin test. A trained physician observes the participant perform these physical function tests and gives each one a value from the scale.</preferredDefinition>
