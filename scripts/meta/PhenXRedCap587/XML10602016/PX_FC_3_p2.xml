    <longName>PhenX  Serial Pregnancy Weight Weights Abstracted From Prenat - PX021701</longName>
    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>Serial measures of weight either (1) abstracted from health care (prenatal) records or (2) measured prospectively for the duration of gestation. Data collected entail (1) weights measured at all prenatal visits; (2) dates of all prenatal visits; (3) reported pre-pregnancy weight; (4) reported or measured height; and (5) gestational age at every prenatal visit and at delivery. If the opportunity exists to collect the gestational weight prospectively as part of the research protocol, this is preferred because weights taken using a research protocol are better standardized for amount of participant clothing and scales are regularly calibrated.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Weights Abstracted from Prenatal and/or Labor and Delivery Charts: Most obstetric practices and prenatal clinics use a standardized form to chart prenatal course. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG, formerly the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) has an Antenatal Record form that is periodically upgraded and available for its members. There are others, such as the POPRAS (ProblemOriented Perinatal Risk Assessment System) or Hollister Maternal/Newborn Record System forms, which are also in common use. All of the standardized forms have places or spaces to report information on gestational age, prepregnancy weight, height, and weights measured during pregnancy at every prenatal visit and dates of examination, and these can be abstracted. For charts with only nurse/physician notes, measured weight should be recorded for each prenatal visit. For women carrying a singleton fetus, the expected schedule of prenatal visits suggested by ACOG is monthly through the 7th month (28 weeks), every 23 weeks through the 9th month (36 weeks), and weekly thereafter until delivery. Weight is occasionally measured at delivery and can be found in the labor and delivery chart along with the gestational age at delivery.</questionText>

     <shortName>PX021701</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>Serial measures of weight either (1) abstracted from health care (prenatal) records or (2) measured prospectively for the duration of gestation. Data collected entail (1) weights measured at all prenatal visits; (2) dates of all prenatal visits; (3) reported pre-pregnancy weight; (4) reported or measured height; and (5) gestational age at every prenatal visit and at delivery. If the opportunity exists to collect the gestational weight prospectively as part of the research protocol, this is preferred because weights taken using a research protocol are better standardized for amount of participant clothing and scales are regularly calibrated.</preferredDefinition>

    <longName>PhenX  Waist Circumference Adult Protocol - PX021602</longName>
    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>Waist circumference is measured at several body sites in the scientific literature. During the National Children's Food Survey, the participant's waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. This protocol is used most commonly for adults and children in European, Asian, and South American surveys and studies, and for children, several area- or country-specific references are available to define a 90th percentile cutoff, which is the main criterion for metabolic syndrome in children. This is important because there are ethnic-specific cutoffs for central (i.e., abdominal) obesity in adults using waist circumference, and it is presumed that comparable racial/ethnic differences exist for children and adolescents. In both children and adults, and compared with measurements taken using other protocols, measurements taken midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest tend to be several centimeters smaller than measurements taken over the iliac crest (NHANES protocol). It is more comparable with measurements taken at the level of the umbilicus (Framingham protocol), except when waist circumference is measured at the level of the umbilicus in an obese participant, and the umbilicus has been displaced downward (i.e., pendulous abdomen). This measurement can be used to calculate a waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) because it will accurately estimate the prevalence in the abnormal range (WHtR greater than 0.5). The relationship of this measure with cardiometabolic risk factors is also comparable with waist circumference measures taken at other sites. NOTE: Waist circumference can be measured on pregnant women. However, national reference data do not include pregnant women, and waist circumference has different associations with abdominal and total body fat among those who are not pregnant.</preferredDefinition>

     <shortName>PX021602</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>Waist circumference is measured at several body sites in the scientific literature. During the National Children’s Food Survey, the participant’s waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest. This protocol is used most commonly for adults and children in European, Asian, and South American surveys and studies, and for children, several area- or country-specific references are available to define a 90th percentile cutoff, which is the main criterion for metabolic syndrome in children. This is important because there are ethnic-specific cutoffs for central (i.e., abdominal) obesity in adults using waist circumference, and it is presumed that comparable racial/ethnic differences exist for children and adolescents. In both children and adults, and compared with measurements taken using other protocols, measurements taken midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest tend to be several centimeters smaller than measurements taken over the iliac crest (NHANES protocol). It is more comparable with measurements taken at the level of the umbilicus (Framingham protocol), except when waist circumference is measured at the level of the umbilicus in an obese participant, and the umbilicus has been displaced downward (i.e., pendulous abdomen). This measurement can be used to calculate a waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) because it will accurately estimate the prevalence in the abnormal range (WHtR greater than 0.5). The relationship of this measure with cardiometabolic risk factors is also comparable with waist circumference measures taken at other sites. NOTE: Waist circumference can be measured on pregnant women. However, national reference data do not include pregnant women, and waist circumference has different associations with abdominal and total body fat among those who are not pregnant.</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>Waist circumference is measured at several body sites in the scientific literature. This protocol is from the Framingham Heart Study in which measurement of the participant’s waist circumference is performed at the level of the umbilicus (i.e., navel or "belly button"). Although this protocol is still used in surveys and studies, care should be taken in using it because it does not rely on reliable bony landmarks and is biased by degree of abdominal obesity. On the other hand, unlike the protocols that require palpation for bony landmarks (which may be problematic with some populations), an umbilicus is visualized or can be located through thin clothing. In both children and adults and compared with measurements taken using other protocols, measurements taken at the level of the umbilicus tend to be roughly comparable with those taken midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest (NCFS protocol) if the participants are at a normal weight, but measurements tend to be more comparable with or even larger than those taken over the iliac crest (NHANES protocol) when the participant is obese and the umbilicus has been displaced downward (i.e., pendulous abdomen). The relationship of this measure with cardiometabolic risk factors is, however, comparable with waist circumference measures taken at other sites.
