    <longName>PhenX PX640105 - Classification of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior Adult Current</longName>
    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale © (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Current version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality during a two time periods-ideation in the past month and suicidal behavior in the past 3 months. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Have you made a suicide attempt?  Have you done anything to harm yourself?  Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  What did you do?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to end your life when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

        <questionText>When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially selfinjurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang  is stopped from doing so.  Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you actually did anything?

     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale © (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Current version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality during a two time periods-ideation in the past month and suicidal behavior in the past 3 months. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Baseline version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Baseline version of the C-SSRS assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior.

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Have you made a suicide attempt?  Have you done anything to harm yourself?  Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  What did you do?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to end your life when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

        <questionText>When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially selfinjurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang  is stopped from doing so.  Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you actually did anything?

Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Baseline version of the C-SSRS assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior. This version is suitable as part of a patient's &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; interview as part of a clinical study.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Have you made a suicide attempt?  Have you done anything to harm yourself?  Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  What did you do?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to end your life when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

     <context>PhenX</context>
     <shortName>PX640107</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Since Last Visit from the Adult version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale © (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior. The Since Last Visit version of the scale assesses suicidality since the patient's last visit. This version is meant to assess patients who have completed at least one initial C-SSRS assessment, and should be used in subsequent visits.</preferredDefinition>
