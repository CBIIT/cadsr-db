        <questionText>Summary of the ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale for DSM5 (CAPS5) The CAPS5 is a 30item semistructured interview that is used to: Make current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD Provide a continuous index of PTSD severity. Assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. In addition to assessing DSM5 PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, and impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization). Most symptom severity ratings are anchored to a combination of symptom frequency and intensity only amnesia and diminished interest are anchored to amount of disturbance and intensity. Administration requires identification of an index traumatic event to serve as the basis for symptom inquiry. The Life Events Checklist for DSM5 (LEC5, see Trauma Adversity and Exposure) is recommended in addition to the Criterion A inquiry included in the CAPS5. Standardized questions and probes are provided for each symptom. The CAPS was designed to be administered by clinicians and clinical researchers who have a working knowledge of PTSD, but can also be administered by appropriately trained paraprofessionals. The full interview takes 4560 minutes to administer.</questionText>

        <questionText>Changes to CAPS for DSM5 (compared to CAPS for DSMIV) CAPS for DSMIV asked respondents to endorse up to three traumatic events to keep in mind during the interview. CAPS5 requires the identification of a single index trauma to serve as the basis of symptom inquiry. CAPS5 is a 30item interview, corresponding to the DSM5 diagnosis for PTSD. The language of the CAPS5 reflects changes to the definition of the traumatic event (Criterion A), changes to existing symptoms, and the addition of new symptoms in DSM5. CAPS5 asks questions relevant to assessing the dissociative subtype of PTSD (depersonalization and derealization), but no longer includes other associated symptoms (e.g., gaps in awareness). As with previous versions of the CAPS, CAPS5 symptom severity ratings are based on symptom frequency and intensity (except for amnesia and diminished interest which are based on amount and intensity). However, CAPS5 items are rated with a single severity score in contrast to previous versions of the CAPS, which required separate frequency and intensity scores. General instructions and scoring information are included with the CAPS5.</questionText>

        <questionText>Sample Item: In the past month, have you had any unwanted memories of (EVENT) while you were awake, so not counting dreams? How does it happen that you start remembering (EVENT)? [If not clear:] (Are these unwanted memories, or are you thinking about [EVENT] on purpose?) How much do these memories bother you? Are you able to put them out of your mind and thing about something else? How often have you had these memories in the past month? # of times ______. Severity Rating: 0. Absent: The respondent denied the problem of the respondent's report doesn't fit the DSM5 symptom criterion. 1. Mild/subthreshold: The respondent described a problem that is consistent with the symptom criterion but isn't severe enough to be considered clinically significant. The problem doesn't satisfy the DSM5 symptom criterion and thus doesn't count toward a PTSD diagnosis. 2. Moderate/threshold: The respondent described a clinically significant problem. The problem satisfies the DSM5 symptom criterion and thus counts toward a PTSD diagnosis. The problem would be a target for intervention. This rating requires a minimum frequency of 2 x month or some of the time (2030%) PLUS a minimum intensity of Clearly Present. 3. Severe/markedly elevated: The respondent described a problem that is above threshold. The problem is difficult to manage and at times overwhelming, and would be a prominent target for intervention. This rating requires a minimum frequency of 2 x week or much of the time (5060%) PLUS a minimum intensity of Pronounced. 4. Extreme/incapacitating: The respondent described a dramatic symptom, far above threshold. The problem is pervasive, unmanageable, and overwhelming, and would be a highpriority target for intervention.</questionText>

        <questionText>Scoring: Detailed scoring information is included with the CAPS5 and should be reviewed carefully before administering. Briefly, the assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM5 PTSD symptoms. Similarly, CAPS5 symptom cluster severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item severity scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM5 cluster: Criterion B (items 15) Criterion C (items 67) Criterion D (items 814) and, Criterion E (items 1520). A symptom cluster score may also be calculated for dissociation by summing items 19 and 20. PTSD diagnostic status is determent by first dichotomizing each symptom as "present" or "absent," then following the DSM5 diagnostic rule. A symptom is considered present only if the corresponding item severity score is rated 2 ("moderate/threshold") or higher. The DSM5 PTSD diagnostic rule requires: At least one Criterion B symptom  At least one Criterion C symptom At least two Criterion D symptoms At least two Criterion E symptoms Criterion F is met (disturbance has lasted one month)Criterion G is met (disturbance cause either clinically significant distress or functional impairment)</questionText>

    <preferredDefinition>The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey is a self-administered questionnaire that that includes 19 items across four functional support subscales: emotional/informational support (8 items), tangible/instrumental support (4 items), affectionate support (3 items), and positive social interaction (3 items). Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert style scale (1 = None of the Time; 5 = All of the Time) to indicate how often that type of support is available to them. A score for each social support subscale can be computed by averaging across the individual items or by adding scores individual items together. Higher scores indicate more support.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey is a self-administered questionnaire that that includes 19 items across four functional support subscales: emotional/informational support (8 items), tangible/instrumental support (4 items), affectionate support (3 items), and positive social interaction (3 items). Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert style scale (1 = None of the Time; 5 = All of the Time) to indicate how often that type of support is available to them. A score for each social support subscale can be computed by averaging across the individual items or by adding scores individual items together. Higher scores indicate more support.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The General Well Being Schedule (GWB) is an 18-item, self-administered questionnaire that was developed for the U.S. Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HANES I). The GWB includes positive and negative questions across six dimensions: positive well-being, self-control, vitality, depression, anxiety, and general health. Each item has the time frame "during the last month," and the first 14 questions use 6-point response scales representing intensity or frequency. The remaining four questions use 0-10 rating scales defined by adjectives at each end. The polarity of items 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 16 is reversed for scoring, and items within each subscale are added together. Lower scores reflect distress and higher scores reflect positive well-being.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Scoring: Items 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 16 are reverse scored. The scores from all items are added together and 14 are subtracted from the total to give a range of 0110. There are three proposed cutpoints: total scores of 060 reflect "severe distress," 6172 "moderate distress," and 73110 "positive wellbeing". Six subscores can be derived. Subscore Label  Question topics. Anxiety: 2. nervousness 5. strain, stress, or pressure 8. anxious, worried, upset16. relaxed, tense Depression: 4. sad, discouraged, hopeless 12. downhearted, blue 18. depressed Positive wellbeing: 1. feeling in general 6. happy, satisfied with life 11. interesting daily life Selfcontrol: 3. firm control of behavior, emotions 7. afraid losing mind, or losing control 13. emotionally stable, sure of self  Vitality: 9. waking fresh, rested 14. feeling tired, worn out 17. energy level General health: 10. bothered by illness 15. concerned, worried about health</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The General Well Being Schedule (GWB) is an 18-item, self-administered questionnaire that was developed for the U.S. Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HANES I). The GWB includes positive and negative questions across six dimensions: positive well-being, self-control, vitality, depression, anxiety, and general health. Each item has the time frame "during the last month," and the first 14 questions use 6-point response scales representing intensity or frequency. The remaining four questions use 0-10 rating scales defined by adjectives at each end. The polarity of items 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 16 is reversed for scoring, and items within each subscale are added together. Lower scores reflect distress and higher scores reflect positive well-being.</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The Baseline and Trauma Challenge Psychophysiological Recordings protocol consists of a Baseline phase and a Trauma Challenge (trauma interview and trauma imagery) phase. During the baseline phase, skin conductance and heart rate are monitored continuously for 5 minutes while the participant rests quietly without talking. During the first part of the Trauma Challenge, heart rate and skin conductance are continuously measured while the participant is administered a 21-question, open-ended trauma interview. After the interview, skin conductance and heart rate are monitored continuously for 60 seconds while the participant is asked to think about and imagine the traumatic event. Derived scores include average skin conductance and heart rate calculated for baseline, trauma interview, and trauma imagery as well as the difference in heart rate and skin conductance between (1) trauma interview and baseline, (2) trauma imagery and baseline, and (3-5) the first and last minutes within each measurement period (baseline, trauma interview, and trauma imagery).</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>BASELINE AND TRAUMA CHALLENGE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS PROTOCOL  Have the individual sit comfortably in a chair. Skin conductance (SC): Any device that records continuously at a rate of 5 samples per second or higher. Add isotonic paste to metal part of electrodes and attach them to fingers. Heart rate (HR): Any device that records continuously at a rate of 20 samples per second or higher. Attach to finger (devices such as pulse oximeters) or wrist (for watch devices). Once device is attached, verify that data is being recorded (either by visual or numerical representation of the data).</questionText>

        <questionText>TRAUMA INTERVIEW (Adapted from Standardized Trauma Interview, Foa &amp; Rothbaum, 1998)  Start recording data and ask the following questions: 1. Please briefly describe the event that happened to you 2. What time of day did it happen? 3. Where did it happen? 4. How long did this event last? That is, how long was it from the moment you first felt like you were in danger until you felt safe again? 5. How long ago did it happen? 6. How much have you slept since it happened? 7. What is your relationship with the perpetrator (if applicable)? 8. Was anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol when it happened? 9. Was anyone else with you? 10. Did you have any injuries? What were they? 11. Do you anticipate longterm physical problems as a result of this event? 12. Was anyone else injured? 13. Was anyone killed? 14. Did you see other people's injury or death? 15. At the time of the incident, did you think you would be seriously injured or killed? 16. During the event, how helpless did you feel? 17. During the event, how horrified or shocked did you feel? 18. During the event, how terrified or afraid did you feel? 19. During the event, how much control did you feel? 20. Have you ever experienced a similar event before? 21. How many times? Mark the end of the interview of stop and save the data as "Trauma interview"</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The Baseline and Trauma Challenge Psychophysiological Recordings protocol consists of a Baseline phase and a Trauma Challenge (trauma interview and trauma imagery) phase. During the baseline phase, skin conductance and heart rate are monitored continuously for 5 minutes while the participant rests quietly without talking. During the first part of the Trauma Challenge, heart rate and skin conductance are continuously measured while the participant is administered a 21-question, open-ended trauma interview. After the interview, skin conductance and heart rate are monitored continuously for 60 seconds while the participant is asked to think about and imagine the traumatic event. Derived scores include average skin conductance and heart rate calculated for baseline, trauma interview, and trauma imagery as well as the difference in heart rate and skin conductance between (1) trauma interview and baseline, (2) trauma imagery and baseline, and (3-5) the first and last minutes within each measurement period (baseline, trauma interview, and trauma imagery).</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Current version of the C-SSRS assesses during predefined time periods-ideation in past 6 months and suicidal behavior over the adolescent's lifetime. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Actual Attempt:  A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.</questionText>

     <shortName>PX640101</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Current version of the C-SSRS assesses during predefined time periods-ideation in past 6 months and suicidal behavior over the adolescent's lifetime. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Baseline version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior.

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Did you ever do anything to try to kill yourself or make yourself not alive anymore? What did you do?  Did you ever hurt yourself on purpose? Why did you do that?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to make yourself not alive anymore when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons, not at all to end your life or kill yourself (like to make yourself feel better, or get something else to happen)? (SelfInjurious Behavior without suicidal intent)</questionText>

     <context>PhenX</context>
     <shortName>PX640102</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Baseline version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Baseline version of the C-SSRS assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior. This version is suitable as part of a patient's &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; interview as part of a clinical study.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the pediatric Since Last Visit from the Pediatric version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Since Last Visit version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality since the subject has begun taking part in a clinical trial and over his or her lifetime. This version is suitable to assess suicidality in subjects who have already been enrolled in a clinical trial but have not yet been assessed using the C-SSRS as part of the trial. This is useful for determining any effects that a particular treatment method may have had on suicidality.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Actual Attempt: A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Did you ever do anything to try to kill yourself or make yourself not alive anymore? What did you do?  Did you ever hurt yourself on purpose? Why did you do that?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to make yourself not alive anymore when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons, not at all to end your life or kill yourself (like to make yourself feel better, or get something else to happen)? (SelfInjurious Behavior without suicidal intent)</questionText>

     <context>PhenX</context>
     <shortName>PX640103</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the pediatric Since Last Visit from the Pediatric version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Since Last Visit version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality since the subject has begun taking part in a clinical trial and over his or her lifetime. This version is suitable to assess suicidality in subjects who have already been enrolled in a clinical trial but have not yet been assessed using the C-SSRS as part of the trial. This is useful for determining any effects that a particular treatment method may have had on suicidality.</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale © (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Current version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality during a two time periods-ideation in the past month and suicidal behavior in the past 3 months. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Have you made a suicide attempt?  Have you done anything to harm yourself?  Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  What did you do?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to end your life when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (SelfInjurious Behavior without suicidal intent)</questionText>

        <questionText>When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially selfinjurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang  is stopped from doing so.  Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you actually did anything?</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale © (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Current version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality during a two time periods-ideation in the past month and suicidal behavior in the past 3 months. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Baseline version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Baseline version of the C-SSRS assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior.

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Have you made a suicide attempt?  Have you done anything to harm yourself?  Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  What did you do?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to end your life when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (SelfInjurious Behavior without suicidal intent)</questionText>

        <questionText>When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially selfinjurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang  is stopped from doing so.  Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you actually did anything?</questionText>

        <questionText>When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops themselves before they actually have engaged in any selfdestructive behavior. Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, except that the individual stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by something else.  Has there been a time when you started to do something to try to end your life but you stopped yourself before you actually did anything?</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Baseline version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Baseline version of the C-SSRS assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior. This version is suitable as part of a patient's &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; interview as part of a clinical study.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Have you made a suicide attempt?  Have you done anything to harm yourself?  Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  What did you do?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to end your life when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

        <questionText>When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially selfinjurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang  is stopped from doing so.  Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you actually did anything?</questionText>

     <context>PhenX</context>
     <shortName>PX640107</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Since Last Visit from the Adult version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale © (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior. The Since Last Visit version of the scale assesses suicidality since the patient's last visit. This version is meant to assess patients who have completed at least one initial C-SSRS assessment, and should be used in subsequent visits.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Suicidality module of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview includes 14 interviewer-administered questions that address suicidal ideation, plans, attempts, intent, lethality, and method in the past 12 months and over a lifetime.

    <longName>PhenX  Intensity Of Suicidal Ideation Continuum Adult - PX640202</longName>
    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) is a 21-item, interviewer-administered scale that measures the current intensity of patients' specific attitudes, behaviors, and plans to commit suicide on the day of the interview and during the time period that they were most suicidal. The first 5 items are screeners (wish to live, wish to die, and desire to attempt suicide), followed by 14 items to assess suicidal risk factors. The last 2 items capture previous suicide attempts. The respondent is first asked all questions about their suicidal ideation on the day of the interview and then queried about the most severe point of suicidal ideation. Each item is rated on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 to 2 according to suicidal intensity. The SSI is scored by adding up the ratings (0-2) from the first 19 items.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) is a 21-item, interviewer-administered scale that measures the current intensity of patients' specific attitudes, behaviors, and plans to commit suicide on the day of the interview and during the time period that they were most suicidal. The first 5 items are screeners (wish to live, wish to die, and desire to attempt suicide), followed by 14 items to assess suicidal risk factors. The last 2 items capture previous suicide attempts. The respondent is first asked all questions about their suicidal ideation on the day of the interview and then queried about the most severe point of suicidal ideation. Each item is rated on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 to 2 according to suicidal intensity. The SSI is scored by adding up the ratings (0-2) from the first 19 items.</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) includes 15 interviewer-administered items that measure behavior before and during the most recent suicide attempt. Items 1-8 cover objective circumstances surrounding the attempt (e.g., preparation and execution of the attempt). Items 9-15 capture perceptions of potential lethality, expectations of rescue, purpose of the attempt, impulsivity, and reaction to the attempt. Each of the 15 items is scored from 0 to 2 and added together to give a total score from 0 to 30. A self-report version of the Suicide Intent Scale is also available.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) includes 15 interviewer-administered items that measure behavior before and during the most recent suicide attempt. Items 1-8 cover objective circumstances surrounding the attempt (e.g., preparation and execution of the attempt). Items 9-15 capture perceptions of potential lethality, expectations of rescue, purpose of the attempt, impulsivity, and reaction to the attempt. Each of the 15 items is scored from 0 to 2 and added together to give a total score from 0 to 30. A self-report version of the Suicide Intent Scale is also available.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Beck Lethality Scales includes eight items that measure the medical lethality of previous suicide attempts (e.g., shooting, jumping, and drug overdose). Each scale is rated from 0 to 10, based on an examination of the patient's physical condition on admission, review of the medical charts, and consultation with the attending physician.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>BECK LETHALITY SCALES   Instructions to interviewer: These scales establish the lethality of patients' suicide attempt(s). Use all available information to establish the lethality of each previous suicide attempt. Enter the date (MM/YY) of each suicide attempt, then code the lethality of each suicide attempt, starting with the MOST recent suicide attempt. If the patient used more than one method, code each method, beginning with the MOST lethal. (Example: on 12/1/95, a patient attempted suicide by consuming a liter of grain alcohol and a gunshot to the abdomen. This would be coded as date: 12/95 primary code 0306 secondary code 0104.)</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The Beck Lethality Scales includes eight items that measure the medical lethality of previous suicide attempts (e.g., shooting, jumping, and drug overdose). Each scale is rated from 0 to 10, based on an examination of the patient's physical condition on admission, review of the medical charts, and consultation with the attending physician.</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) is a structured interview that includes five modules assessing the presence, frequency, and characteristics of five types of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors: suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, suicidal gestures, suicidal attempts (including aborted and interrupted), and nonsuicidal self-injury. Each module begins with a screening question about lifetime presence of a self-injurious thought or behavior followed by items that measure age of onset, recent thoughts and behaviors, severity of thoughts and behaviors, probability of future behavior, and self-reported precipitants and functions of the behavior. In addition to the adult and adolescent sort form presented below, other versions of the SITBI are available: adult and adolescent long form, follow-up short form (prospective studies), and self-report.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) is a structured interview that includes five modules assessing the presence, frequency, and characteristics of five types of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors: suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, suicidal gestures, suicidal attempts (including aborted and interrupted), and nonsuicidal self-injury. Each module begins with a screening question about lifetime presence of a self-injurious thought or behavior followed by items that measure age of onset, recent thoughts and behaviors, severity of thoughts and behaviors, probability of future behavior, and self-reported precipitants and functions of the behavior. In addition to the adult and adolescent sort form presented below, other versions of the SITBI are available: adult and adolescent long form, follow-up short form (prospective studies), and self-report.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Hopelessness Scale for Children (HSC) consists of 17 interviewer-administered true-false items. The HSC is modeled on the Beck Hopelessness Scale and captures feelings about the future, loss of motivation, and future expectations. "True" responses to the following items are scored as "1": For items 2, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17, "True" responses are scored as "1." For items1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 16, "False" responses are scored as "1." The higher the total score, the greater the hopelessness for the future.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Hopelessness Scale for Children (HSC) consists of 17 interviewer-administered true-false items. The HSC is modeled on the Beck Hopelessness Scale and captures feelings about the future, loss of motivation, and future expectations. "True" responses to the following items are scored as "1": For items 2, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17, "True" responses are scored as "1." For items1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 16, "False" responses are scored as "1." The higher the total score, the greater the hopelessness for the future.</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) consists of 29 self-administered items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The BPAQ includes four subscales: Physical Aggression (items 1-9), Verbal Aggression (items 10-14), Anger (items 15-21), and Hostility (items 22-29.) The score for each scale is the sum or the ratings for its items. The two items (7 and 18) worded in the direction opposite to aggression are reverse-scored. The total score for aggression is the sum of these scale scores. Higher scores indicate higher aggressive behavior.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a brief, self-administered questionnaire that captures the respondent's perception of his or her current insomnia. The ISI has been used with adolescents and adults. The ISI includes seven items that assess severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems; sleep dissatisfaction; interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning; noticeability of sleep problems by others; and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale, and the total score ranges from 0 to 28. A higher score suggests more severe insomnia.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a brief, self-administered questionnaire that captures the respondent's perception of his or her current insomnia. The ISI has been used with adolescents and adults. The ISI includes seven items that assess severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems; sleep dissatisfaction; interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning; noticeability of sleep problems by others; and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale, and the total score ranges from 0 to 28. A higher score suggests more severe insomnia.</preferredDefinition>
