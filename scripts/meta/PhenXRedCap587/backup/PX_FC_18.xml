    <preferredDefinition>The Important and Health Matters Social Network Battery is an interviewer-administered survey that captures the names of all individuals within a respondent's social network and the relationship between these individuals. The high-burden protocol is a semi-structured interview that has both open-ended and close-ended questions. On average, it takes 15-20 minutes to complete because individuals usually provide 4-7 names.</preferredDefinition>

These can be family, friends, people who have been really helpful to youwhat we are interested in are the ones that you are most likely to talk to about really important matters in your life, whether they live near you or far away. Who are the people in your life with whom you discuss important matters? Who are the people you can really count on? 2. Is there anyone who always wants to talk to you about your important matters in your life whether you want them to or not? 3. Are there people who are, in general, a burden to you, because they want to discuss matters important to them, even if you don't? 4. Have there been any important changes in this recently? In other words, were there people whom you used to discuss important matters with that you would not or no longer talk to about such things? These could be people whom you no longer feel close to, who might have moved or died. Who are they?</questionText>

        <questionText>5. I'm interested in the people in your life that you talk to about health problems when they come up. Who are the people that you discuss your health with or you can really count on when you have physical or emotional problems? 6. Who are the people, whether or not you have mentioned them before, who are always talking about your mental and physical health and trying to get you to do things about them? 7. Are there people who are, in general, a burden to you because of their emotional or physical health problems and always want to talk to you about their problems, whether you want them to or not? 8. Have there been any important changes in any of these lists? In other words, were there people whom you used to discuss health issues with or that you would rely on for help that you would not or no longer talk to about such things? These could be people whom you no longer feel close to, who might have moved or died.</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The Important and Health Matters Social Network Battery is an interviewer-administered survey that captures the names of all individuals within a respondent's social network and the relationship between these individuals. The high-burden protocol is a semi-structured interview that has both open-ended and close-ended questions. On average, it takes 15-20 minutes to complete because individuals usually provide 4-7 names.</preferredDefinition>

    <longName>PhenX  Neighborhood Concentrated Disadvantage - PX211301</longName>
    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The protocol is based on extracting data from the U.S. Census Bureau on a set of variables related to the concept of "concentrated disadvantage" (Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997). All the relevant variables are available from the long form of the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses. Once the data are extracted, an index score of concentrated disadvantage can be calculated at the neighborhood level of interest; this is usually based on census tract or census block-group data.



All the necessary variables used in calculating concentrated disadvantage are included in the American Community Survey.  As of summer 2010, concentrated disadvantage can be calculated from 3-year estimates (e.g., 2005-2007) of the American Community Survey, but for only a limited set of geographical levels. Once American Community Survey 5-year estimates (e.g., 2005-2009) become available in fall 2010, it should be possible to calculate concentrated disadvantage at smaller census geographies, including census tract and census block-group levels.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>The technical documentation for the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses are available online at American Factfinder (http://factfinder.census.gov). Select the Data Sets link, and then select Decennial Census. Different tabs allow the user to select 2000 or 1990 data or materials. Specific data sets are then selected by clicking in dataspecific radio buttons (e.g., for Census 2000 options, include SF1 or SF3). SF1 refers to Summary File 1 (the short form of the U.S. Census collected on everyone and referred to as "100% data"), and SF3 refers to Summary File 3 (the long form of the U.S. Census collected on detailed population and housing variables from a oneinsix [16%17%] sample and weighted to represent the total population). For each data set, the user can create table and maps, extract data, or consult technical documentation. Users not familiar with Census data should consult the technical materials. The technical documentation for SF1 and SF3 data sets are available at the U.S. Census website: SF1: &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The protocol is based on extracting data from the U.S. Census Bureau on a set of variables related to the concept of "concentrated disadvantage" (Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997). All the relevant variables are available from the long form of the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses. Once the data are extracted, an index score of concentrated disadvantage can be calculated at the neighborhood level of interest; this is usually based on census tract or census block-group data.



All the necessary variables used in calculating concentrated disadvantage are included in the American Community Survey.  As of summer 2010, concentrated disadvantage can be calculated from 3-year estimates (e.g., 2005-2007) of the American Community Survey, but for only a limited set of geographical levels. Once American Community Survey 5-year estimates (e.g., 2005-2009) become available in fall 2010, it should be possible to calculate concentrated disadvantage at smaller census geographies, including census tract and census block-group levels.</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The protocol is based on extracting data from the U.S. Census Bureau on a set of variables related to the concept of residential segregation. Residential segregation describes the distribution of different race/ethnic groups across smaller areal units (e.g., census tracts) within larger areas (e.g., counties or metropolitan statistical areas [MSAs]). 

All the relevant variables are available from the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses. Once the data are extracted the proposed measure, the Dissimilarity Index can be calculated. The protocol here describes the process using Summary File 1 (SF1) files (i.e., 100% sample data) from the 2000 Census. The Dissimilarity Index is one of the most commonly used race/ethnic residential segregation measures.

All the necessary variables used in calculating residential segregation will be available from the 2010 Census. At time of writing (summer 2010) the 2010 Census has not been released, but once available it should be possible to calculate the Dissimilarity Index using input data from census tract and census block-group levels. It is mandated by law that the first population count data should be released before March 31, 2011.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>The Dissimilarity Index is based on U.S. Census data. The technical documentation for the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses are available online at American Factfinder (http://factfinder.census.gov). Select Data Sets link, and then select Decennial Census. Different tabs allow the user to select 2000 or 1990 data and/or materials. Specific data sets are then selected by clicking in dataspecific radio buttons (e.g., for Census 2000 options, include SF1 or SF3). SF1 refers to Summary File 1 (the short form of the U.S. Census collected on everyone, and referred to as 100% data), and SF3 refers to Summary File 3 (the long form of the U.S. Census collected on detailed population and housing variables from a oneinsix [16%17%] sample and weighted to represent the total population). For each data set, the user can create tables and maps, extract data, or consult technical documentation. Users not familiar with Census data should consult the technical materials. The technical documentation for SF1 and SF3 data sets are available at the U.S. Census Bureau website: SF1: &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf1.pdf&lt;/a&gt; SF3: &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf3.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf3.pdf&lt;/a&gt; Race and Ethnicity data can be found in SF1 and SF3 (as well as other Census data products). Here, we focus on SF1 and data based on the 100% sample in 2000. The key race/ethnicity data in SF1 (100%) are found in "Table P8. Hispanic or Latino by Race." This table is preferred over other possible race and race/ethnic tables available, as it provides data on the main race/ethnic groups in the United States and explicitly incorporates data on Hispanic or Latino populations, otherwise not available in the raceonly tables. The race/ethnic data are available for all small census geographiessuch as census block, census block group, and census tractand TRUNCATED</questionText>

        <questionText>Researchers can use the data in this table to easily calculate basic variables (e.g., the percentage of any race and/or ethnicity group) or to combine groups (e.g., all minorities). The Dissimilarity Index provides data on larger areas (e.g., metropolitan statistical areas) using smaller level data. The most common conceptualization of residential segregation is based on the dimension of evenness. Evenness refers to the differential distribution of the subject population across neighborhoods in a large area (e.g., metropolitan area). It ranges from 0 (complete integration) to 1 (complete segregation) and indicates the percentage of a group's population that would have to change residence for each neighborhood to have the same percentage of that group as the metropolitan area overall. It is computed as:</questionText>

        <questionText>where   n is the number of tracts in the larger area (e.g., a metropolitan area), xi is the population size of the minority group of interest in tract i, X is the population of the minority group in the larger area (e.g., metropolitan area) as a whole, yi is the population of the reference group (usually nonHispanic Whites) in tract i, and, Y is the population of the reference group in the larger area (e.g., metropolitan) area as a whole.  The calculation requires the computation of the totals for each group across all subareas within a larger region (e.g., all census tracts within a county), the proportion of each group within each subarea, the absolute difference between the proportions, and the sum of the absolute differences. The latter number is multiplied by 0.5 to generate a result between 0.0 and 1.0. A value of 0.0 would indicate there were the same proportions of majority and minority group populations in each subarea, as in the larger regions' population. If all subareas within the region contain members of just one group (i.e., there is no coresidence) then D equals 1.0, indicating complete segregation. Extending the Dissimilarity Index: The Multigroup Analog   While much early research on segregation looked at two groups (e.g., Black and White, or majority and minority), today's society is multiethnic. Twogroup measures are useful but limited for describing complex patterns of segregation. The choice to use a twogroup or multigroup D depends on the specific question of interest. In a region where the population is composed of three groups (e.g., White nonHispanic, Black nonHispanic, and Hispanic), we may be interested in  a) segregation between two specific groups (e.g., How segregated are White from Black residents?) or  b) segregation among all three groups (e.g., How segregated are White nonHispanic, Black nonHispanic, and Hispanic residents from each other?). The twogroup measure can still be used by comparing all possible pairs TRUNCATED</questionText>

        <questionText>The interpretation of multigroup D (sometimes labeled as D(m)) is the same as D (see Wong, 1993). In the Stata statistical software package, the command seg (installed by typing "ssc install seg" from within Stata) will compute D (Reardon, 2002). Researchers have extended segregation measures by incorporating the spatial dimension (see White, 1983 Wong, 1993 Reardon &amp; O'Sullivan, 2004). There are spatially modified versions of the D index (see Wong, 1993).</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The protocol is based on extracting data from the U.S. Census Bureau on a set of variables related to the concept of residential segregation. Residential segregation describes the distribution of different race/ethnic groups across smaller areal units (e.g., census tracts) within larger areas (e.g., counties or metropolitan statistical areas [MSAs]). 

All the relevant variables are available from the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses. Once the data are extracted the proposed measure, the Dissimilarity Index can be calculated. The protocol here describes the process using Summary File 1 (SF1) files (i.e., 100% sample data) from the 2000 Census. The Dissimilarity Index is one of the most commonly used race/ethnic residential segregation measures.

All the necessary variables used in calculating residential segregation will be available from the 2010 Census. At time of writing (summer 2010) the 2010 Census has not been released, but once available it should be possible to calculate the Dissimilarity Index using input data from census tract and census block-group levels. It is mandated by law that the first population count data should be released before March 31, 2011.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The latest Tanner and Whitehouse Method, sometimes referred to as TW2, involves the interpretation of a radiograph of the left hand and wrist by a trained radiologist. The procedure includes the assessment of regions of interest (ROI) on 20 bones. The ROI include the epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis of each bone. The radiologist gives each ROI a numerical score and records the result. The numerical score of each ROI is summed to produce a total score.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>The TannerWhitehouse Test is an online tool which was developed by Lorentz Jantschi and Sorana Bolboaca and is available at: &lt;a href="http://vl.academicdirect.org/medical_informatics/bone_age/v1.0/" target="_blank"&gt;vl.academicdirect.org/medical_informatics/bone_age/v1.0/&lt;/a&gt; The tool describes various findings associated with each of the following 20 regions of interest (ROI) of the left hand as seen on xray. The ROIs are the: Radius  Ulna  First, third, and fifth metacarpal  Proximal phalanx of the thumb, third finger, and fifth finger Middle phalanx of the third and fifth finger  Distal phalanx of the thumb, third finger, and fifth finger  Capitate  Hamate  Triquetral  Lunate  Scaphoid Trapezium Trapezoid .Users select a finding that matches what they see on the xray. Each finding has two xray images, a drawing and a written description. Once a selection is made for each ROI, the users enters the patient's name*, address, xray date, diagnostic, gender, weight, height and age (in years and months, for example 11 years and 3 months). Then the program calculates the individual's bone age based upon the standard atlas associated with the Tanner and Whitehouse method. *See Specific Instructions for suggestions regarding personal identifying information.</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The latest Tanner and Whitehouse Method, sometimes referred to as TW2, involves the interpretation of a radiograph of the left hand and wrist by a trained radiologist. The procedure includes the assessment of regions of interest (ROI) on 20 bones. The ROI include the epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis of each bone. The radiologist gives each ROI a numerical score and records the result. The numerical score of each ROI is summed to produce a total score.</preferredDefinition>

Most of the items are negatively worded, so the only 2 items that do not need to be reverse coded are 'been confident' and 'felt that you were attractive' Original code: ('never'=0, 'almost never'=1, 'sometimes'=2, 'fairly often'=3, 'almost all of the time'=4) To reverse code: ('never'=4, 'almost never'=3, 'sometimes'=2, 'fairly often'=1, 'almost all of the time'=0) Totals: Calculated as the total sum of the items in each subscale COHIPSF 19 Total is the total sum of all 19 items For missing items: do not calculate subscales with missing items or total scale</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The Child Oral Health Impact Profile-Short Form 19 (COHIP-SF 19) is a 19-item interviewer-administered questionnaire about the oral health of a child to assess the child’s quality of life. This questionnaire can be administered to children aged 8-17 years old. The COHIP-SF 19 is derived from the Child Oral Health Impact Profile, which is administered to parents and contains 34 questions. The COHIP-SF 19 covers the areas of school environment, self-image, social-emotional well-being, and functional well-being.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) can be used to evaluate the progression of mitochondrial disease. There are three versions of the NPMDS, each for a specific age range (0-24 months, 2-11 years, and 12-18 years). The NMDAS is for adult patients over 16 years. The scales allow for standardization of patient assessment and to improve accurate data collection. The scales are composed of multiple domains: Current Function, System Specific Involvement, Current Clinical Assessment and Quality of Life. Almost all questions provide a score which ranges from 0 to 3, with the following representations: 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe. Examples of severity for each question are provided. Depending upon the domain, the questions are either self- or interviewer-administrated, based on a provider’s clinical assessment or medical records. There is a manual for each scale, which details the administration, process, and scoring instructions.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) can be used to evaluate the progression of mitochondrial disease. There are three versions of the NPMDS, each for a specific age range (0-24 months, 2-11 years, and 12-18 years). The NMDAS is for adult patients over 16 years. The scales allow for standardization of patient assessment and to improve accurate data collection. The scales are composed of multiple domains: Current Function, System Specific Involvement, Current Clinical Assessment and Quality of Life. Almost all questions provide a score which ranges from 0 to 3, with the following representations: 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe. Examples of severity for each question are provided. Depending upon the domain, the questions are either self- or interviewer-administrated, based on a provider’s clinical assessment or medical records. There is a manual for each scale, which details the administration, process, and scoring instructions.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) can be used to evaluate the progression of mitochondrial disease. There are three versions of the NPMDS, each for a specific age range (0-24 months, 2-11 years, and 12-18 years). The NMDAS is for adult patients over 16 years. The aim of the scales is to allow for standardization of patient assessment and to improve accurate data collection. The scales are composed of multiple domains: Current Function, System Specific Involvement, Current Clinical Assessment, and Quality of Life. Almost all questions provide a score which ranges from 0-3, with the following representations: 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 moderate, and 3 severe. Examples of each severity for each question are provided. Depending on the domain, the questions are either self-administrated or based on a provider’s clinical assessment. There is a manual for each scale, which details the administration, process, and scoring instructions.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) can be used to evaluate the progression of mitochondrial disease. There are three versions of the NPMDS, each for a specific age range (0-24 months, 2-11 years, and 12-18 years). The NMDAS is for adult patients over 16 years. The investigators from Newcastle University recommend that if the child experiences early onset of a mitochondrial disease in childhood, the NPMDS 12-18 year scale should be used. If an adolescent experiences onset of a mitochondrial disease, the investigators recommend switching to the NMDAS scale at 16 years. The scales allow for standardization of patient assessment and to improve accurate data collection. The scales are composed of multiple domains: Current Function, System Specific Involvement, Current Clinical Assessment, and Quality of Life. Almost all questions provide a score which ranges from 0-3, with the following representations: 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe. Examples of severity for each question are provided. Depending on the domain, the questions are either self- or interviewer-administrated, based on a provider’s clinical assessment or medical records.

     <preferredDefinition>The Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) can be used to evaluate the progression of mitochondrial disease. There are three versions of the NPMDS, each for a specific age range (0-24 months, 2-11 years, and 12-18 years). The NMDAS is for adult patients over 16 years. The investigators from Newcastle University recommend that if the child experiences early onset of a mitochondrial disease in childhood, the NPMDS 12-18 year scale should be used. If an adolescent experiences onset of a mitochondrial disease, the investigators recommend switching to the NMDAS scale at 16 years. The scales allow for standardization of patient assessment and to improve accurate data collection. The scales are composed of multiple domains: Current Function, System Specific Involvement, Current Clinical Assessment, and Quality of Life. Almost all questions provide a score which ranges from 0-3, with the following representations: 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe. Examples of severity for each question are provided. Depending on the domain, the questions are either self- or interviewer-administrated, based on a provider’s clinical assessment or medical records. There is a manual for each scale, which details the administration, process, and scoring instructions.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The American Thoracic Society (ATS) policy statement regarding Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a comprehensive guide for diagnosing an individual with CCHS by evaluating their phenotype and determining their paired-like homeobox gene (PHOX2B) genotype. Evaluation via the ATS statement involves completion of (1) the Autonomic Nervous System Questionnaire (ANSQ), (2) stepwise PHOX2B genetic testing, and (3) physiologic and other clinical testing.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ANSQ is a self-administered questionnaire including 46 questions with the purpose of measuring Autonomic Nervous System Dysregulation. It is also available as a REDCap Registry through a research protocol.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic testing&lt;/strong&gt; to identify CCHS-related mutations in the PHOX2B gene involves step-wise testing with Step 1. PHOX2B Screening Test, Step 2. PHOX2B Sequencing Test, and Step 3. PHOX2B MLPA Test.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiologic and other clinical testing&lt;/strong&gt; during wakefulness and sleep and other testing to evaluate patients in activities of daily living in keeping with the ATS 2010 Statement on CCHS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>The American Thoracic Society (ATS) policy statement regarding Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a comprehensive guide for diagnosing an individual with CCHS by evaluating their phenotype and determining their paired-like homeobox gene (PHOX2B) genotype. Evaluation via the ATS statement involves completion of (1) the Autonomic Nervous System Questionnaire (ANSQ), (2) stepwise PHOX2B genetic testing, and (3) physiologic and other clinical testing.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ANSQ is a self-administered questionnaire including 46 questions with the purpose of measuring Autonomic Nervous System Dysregulation. It is also available as a REDCap Registry through a research protocol.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic testing&lt;/strong&gt; to identify CCHS-related mutations in the PHOX2B gene involves step-wise testing with Step 1. PHOX2B Screening Test, Step 2. PHOX2B Sequencing Test, and Step 3. PHOX2B MLPA Test.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiologic and other clinical testing&lt;/strong&gt; during wakefulness and sleep and other testing to evaluate patients in activities of daily living in keeping with the ATS 2010 Statement on CCHS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The British Society of Echocardiography (BSE) Education Committee guidelines for a standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) consist of a minimum dataset and a recommended sequence on how to perform a comprehensive assessment. The recommendations are based on the key expected components of a standard adult transthoracic study. Therefore, the minimum dataset may only be sufficient when the echocardiographic study is entirely normal. If abnormalities are detected, additional echocardiograms, which are outlined in supplemental datasets, may be required. The supplemental datasets include protocols for how to interpret an echocardiogram for one of the five cardiac abnormalities: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, assessment for mitral valve repair, mitral stenosis and assessment for percutaneous mitral commissurotomy, and Marfan syndrome. Additional supplemental datasets are under development. All datasets are available from the BSE website: [link[www.bsecho.org|www.bsecho.org]]. Both the minimum and supplemental datasets contain the following: &lt;ul type=disc&gt; &lt;li&gt;a visual example of an ideal image that should be obtained in each acoustic window&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;information for each image regarding the view, modality, measurements, and an explanatory note (if applicable).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>The My Family Health Portrait (MFHP) is available at the following website: https://familyhistory.hhs.gov/FHH/html/index.html  The online tool includes questions about the individual followed by questions about each close family member. Once the required fields and health information are entered into the online tool, a pedigree containing all relevant information can be generated. Important notes regarding the features and limitations of the MFHP: Although the MFHP can generate a pedigree, it does not store the information. But the information can be downloaded by the user and reloaded anytime for updates. Information from the MFHP is not meant to substitute for professional medical advice or care. Hence the MFHP does not provide personalized medical advice for an individual/their relatives for any condition or treatment. Users of the MFHP should consult a health care professional regarding medical advice/concerns/implications/questions due to their pedigree. The MFHP can be incorporated into an organization's suite of electronic information services without charge or royalty however, an End User Agreement is required. If the MFHP is incorporated into an organization, customization is permitted however, the standardsbased features must be preserved. Details on the incorporation process are available by selecting the "Learn More About My Family Health Portrait" on the MFHP website. The MFHP is normally used for common diseases such as diabetes and cancer, so new diseases would need to be added. The user can add diseases in the "other" field of the form</questionText>

    <preferredDefinition>The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts include both standard graph lines and a series of percentile curves that demonstrate the distribution of certain body measurements in individuals. Each growth chart may illustrate a specific gender and age range. The percentile curves on each chart depend on which measurement is being recorded. The percentile curves on the WHO and CDC growth charts are for individuals who appear to be unaffected by a condition impacting growth. To provide information for special populations, growth charts for specific conditions have been developed; these growth charts contain percentile curves for the distribution of body measurements in individuals with the specific condition. Some conditions with a specific growth chart are cerebral palsy, achondroplasia, Turner syndrome, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).</preferredDefinition>

To subtract, it will be necessary to convert months to days and years to months if either the month or day in the birth data is larger than in the date of measurements. When converting one month to days, subtract 1 from the number of months in the date of measurement, then add 28, 30, or 31, as appropriate, to the number of days. When converting one year to months, subtract 1 from the number of years in the date of measurement, then add 12 to the number of months.</questionText>

        <questionText>6 Interpret the plotted measurements The curved lines on the growth chart show selected percentiles that indicate the rank of the child's measurement. For example, when the dot is plotted on the 95th percentile line on the CDC BMIforage growth chart, it means that 5 of 100 children (5%) of the same age and sex in the reference population have a higher BMIforage. The WHO growth standard charts use the 2nd and the 98th percentiles as the outer most percentile cutoff values indicating abnormal growth. The CDC growth reference charts use the 5th and the 95th percentiles as the outermost percentile cutoff values indicating abnormal growth. Interpret the plotted measurements based on the percentile ranking on the WHO or the CDC growth charts and the percentile cutoff value corresponding to the nutrition indicator shown in the table below. If the percentile rank indicates a nutritionrelated health concern, additional monitoring and assessment are recommended.  Determine the percentile rank.  Determine if the percentile rank suggests that the anthropometric index is indicative of nutritional risk based on the percentile cutoff value.  Compare today's percentile rank with the rank from previous visits to identify any major shifts in the child's growth pattern and the need for further assessment.  When transitioning from the WHO growth charts to the CDC growth charts at aged 2 years, a change in growth classification may occur. During this transition, caution should be used in interpreting any changes in classification</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts include both standard graph lines and a series of percentile curves that demonstrate the distribution of certain body measurements in individuals. Each growth chart may illustrate a specific gender and age range. The percentile curves on each chart depend on which measurement is being recorded. The percentile curves on the WHO and CDC growth charts are for individuals who appear to be unaffected by a condition impacting growth. To provide information for special populations, growth charts for specific conditions have been developed; these growth charts contain percentile curves for the distribution of body measurements in individuals with the specific condition. Some conditions with a specific growth chart are cerebral palsy, achondroplasia, Turner syndrome, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>PROMIS© Version 1.1 Pediatric Profile 25 consists of seven item banks. There is one bank for physical function mobility, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, peer relationships, pain interference, and pain intensity. For each question, the respondent is asked to reflect on the past 7 days. The pain intensity item bank contains one question with a 10-point answer scale. The other banks each contain four questions, and each question has a 5-point answer scale. PROMIS© 25 is administrated as a self-reported questionnaire for children aged 8-17 or via a parent proxy for children aged 5-17. A pediatric proxy item bank was developed for those aged 5-17 years as part of PROMIS to address the need for health status instruments reflecting the perspectives of both the child and parent in cases where a child is too young, cognitively impaired, or unwell to complete a patient-reported outcome instrument and a parent proxy report is required.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>PROMIS© Version 1.1 Pediatric Profile 25 consists of seven item banks. There is one bank for physical function mobility, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, peer relationships, pain interference, and pain intensity. For each question, the respondent is asked to reflect on the past 7 days. The pain intensity item bank contains one question with a 10-point answer scale. The other banks each contain four questions, and each question has a 5-point answer scale. PROMIS© 25 is administrated as a self-reported questionnaire for children aged 8-17 or via a parent proxy for children aged 5-17. A pediatric proxy item bank was developed for those aged 5-17 years as part of PROMIS to address the need for health status instruments reflecting the perspectives of both the child and parent in cases where a child is too young, cognitively impaired, or unwell to complete a patient-reported outcome instrument and a parent proxy report is required.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) was developed by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons®, Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Shriners Hospitals. The protocol here is based on Version 2.0 of the PODCI which was revised, renumbered, and reformatted in August 2005. The PODCI consists of 86 items and is designed to collect data regarding an individual’s general health and problems related to bone and muscle conditions. This instrument is completed by parents (or caregivers) of children aged 2-10 years old. Note: this protocol applies to the three major types of scoliosis; however, only congenital and syndromic scoliosis apply to rare genetic conditions.</preferredDefinition>

The protocol here is based on Version 2.0 of the PODCI which was revised, renumbered, and reformatted in August 2005. The PODCI consists of 86 items and is designed to collect data regarding an individual’s general health and problems related to bone and muscle conditions. This instrument is completed by parents (or caregivers) of children aged 2-10 years old. Note: this protocol applies to the three major types of scoliosis; however, only congenital and syndromic scoliosis apply to rare genetic conditions.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>This is a screening test to determine if an individual has scoliosis or signs of scoliosis. While bending forward the individual has their feet together, knees straight, and their arms dangling by their sides. If signs of scoliosis are observed, an xray with Cobb technique is recommended. Signs of scoliosis include imbalances in the rib cage (i.e., one side is higher than the other), and other deformities along the back.</questionText>

        <questionText>Identify the superior and the inferior end vertebrae the vertebrae with the greatest tilt at the proximal and distal ends of the curve. The angle between them is measured by drawing a line from the top of the superior end vertebra parallel to the upper endplate, and another line from the bottom of the inferior end vertebra parallel to the lower endplate. Perpendicular lines are then constructed at right angles to the lines along the endplates. The angle formed by the intersection of the perpendicular lines defines the Cobb angle. This angle is then compared to a standard scale in order to determine whether or not the curvature is potentially harmful. Individuals with a straight spine have zero degree curve.</questionText>

        <questionText>The following description is a summary. See Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document C34A2 for the full protocol. The test should be performed at a CFF accredited laboratory. In addition, the CFF has also provided testing guidelines (LeGrys et al., 2007) that should be followed. Pilocarpine is applied to gauze or filter paper. Electrodes are attached to the gauze or filter paperThe electrodes are attached to the newborn's lower arm or upper leg for about 5 minutes. Sweat collection should not occur longer than 30 minutes. Collect a minimum of 75 mg of sweat. Quantitatively analyze the sweat for chloride concentration by coulometric titration using a chloridometer, or using the Schales and Schales mercuric nitrate procedure or an automated analyzer that has been validated against the other methods. It is recommended but not required that the test be repeated on the newborn.</questionText>

        <questionText>EEATING DISORDER EXAMINATION (Edition 17.0D) THE INTERVIEW SCHEDULE ORIENTATION TO THE TIME PERIOD What we are going to do is a partially structured interview in which I will ask you about your eating habits and your feelings about your shape, and weight. Because a standard set of questions is going to be asked, please note that some may not apply to you. Most of the questions focus on the past four weeks (that is, the last 28 days), but there will be some that extend out to cover the previous three months. I know this will test your memory because the weeks tend to blend together. What I have done to help you is to make this calendar for the last 28 days [show the blank calendar  see Table 2] it ends on yesterday because today is not over yet. So it goes from yesterday (day and date) to (day and date). I know it seems strange to have the weekends in the middle, but that is just the way it has worked out. And here are the dates for the two months before that, (date) to (date). And to help you remember these periods, I have noted down the holidays (e.g., May Bank Holiday, Thanksgiving). What I would like you to do now is tell me about any events that have happened in the past 28 days since this will help us discuss these four weeks. Have there been any events out of the ordinary .......... such as celebrations of any type, trips away or days off work? Then we can note these down on the calendar. [These should be noted on the calendar (see Table 2) thereby allowing the interviewer and participant to use it as an aide memoire.] INTRODUCTORY QUESTIONS [Having oriented the participant to the specific time period being assessed, it is best to open the interview by asking a number of introductory questions designed to obtain a general picture of the participant's eating habits. Suitable questions are suggested below.]</questionText>

        <questionText>Scoring: The EDE, and its selfreported versions, EDEQ, generate two types of data. First they provide frequency data on key behavioral features of eating disorders in terms of number of episodes of the behavior and in some instances number of days on which the behavior has occurred. Second, they provide subscales scores reflecting the severity of aspects of the psychopathology of eating disorders. The subscales are Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern and Weight Concern. To obtain a particular subscale score, the ratings for the relevant items (listed below) are added together and the sum divided by the total number of items forming the subscales. If ratings are only available on some items, a score may nevertheless be obtained by dividing the resulting total by the number of rated items so long as more than half the items have been rated. To obtain an overall or "global" score, the four subscales scores are summed and the resulting total divided by the number of subscales (i.e. four). Subscales score are reported as means and standard deviations.</questionText>
