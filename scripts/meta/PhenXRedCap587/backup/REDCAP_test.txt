		    <preferredDefinition>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) for &lt;i&gt;The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&lt;/i&gt; Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (is a 30-item, semistructured interview that is used to make a current (past-month) or lifetime diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to provide a continuous index of PTSD severity. It also can be used to assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. In addition to assessing the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, and impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, and features for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization). Administration requires identification of an index traumatic event to serve as the basis for symptom inquiry. The &lt;a href="index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails&amp;id=630101"&gt;Life Events Checklist&lt;/a&gt; for DSM-5 (LEC-5) is recommended prior to the Criterion A inquiry included in the CAPS-5. Standardized questions and probes are provided for each symptom.</preferredDefinition>
