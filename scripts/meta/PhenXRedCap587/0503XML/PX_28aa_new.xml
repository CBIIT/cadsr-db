        <questionText>Have a look at the questions. These questions are about things you do while either sitting or lying. Using a computer for fun includes e-mailing, chat rooms, blogs, surfing the net and e-games. Being tutored means any additional academic tutoring or coaching you may get outside of school hours. Hobbies and crafts also include things like card and board games. Include texting, while sitting around -- but only if you are sitting and texting, not walking and texting. Saturday School means going to community classes for either cultural or religious instruction. What we would like you to do in a moment is think about a NORMAL school week and write down how much time you spend doing the following activities before and after school each day Monday to Friday).

It's what you do during this time that we are asking about in the weekdays' question. If you do two activities at the same time, say, doing your homework in front of the TV for an hour, then write down how much time you spent on each of these activities, for example, 45 minutes watching TV and 15 minutes on your homework. Don't double up the time! (Researcher to do example question before class starts completing questionnaire.) Before you start, let's look at the first question together. The first line of this question looks at how much TV you watch during the week, before and after school. So what you will need to do in a moment is write down the amount of time in numbers in the boxes. We would prefer that you write minutes, but you can write in hours if need be. For example: if I watch one and a half hours of TV on a Monday night, I would put ei..TRUNCATED(have_a_look_at_the_first_p)</questionText>

Several tests (for example, situp and curlup tests) have been developed to measure mainly abdominal muscular strength and endurance. We are going to use an abdominal muscular strength and endurance test called the "YMCA Half SitUp" test, which is a curlup test since you lift your trunk only partially off the floor. Equipment/Test Setting: Mat or rug, Stopwatch or watch with a second hand, Four strips of tape to place 3.5 inches apart on mat or rug to provide start and end position for the curlup.

        <questionText>Prepare the mat or rug with the tape strips as shown in the picture. You need to be able to feel the tape as your fingers move across the mat or rug from the starting and ending positions. We recommend that you do the test with a partner. Directions:   1. Lie faceup on mat or rug with knees at a right angle (that is, 90°) and feet flat on the ground. The feet are not held down.  2. Place hands with palms facing down on the mat or rug with the fingers touching the first piece of tape.  3. Flatten your lower back to the mat or rug, and half situp so that your fingers move from the first piece of tape to the second. Then return your shoulders to the mat or rug and repeat the movement as described. Your head does not have to touch the surface. Keep your lower back flat on the mat or rug during the movements  if you arch your back, it can cause injury.  4. Your partner will count the number of half situps performed in one minute. Pace yourself so you can do half situps for one minute.  5. Record your results. *Used with permission from Fitness Testing and Assessment Manual, 4th ed. © 2000 by YMCA of the USA, Chicago.

        <questionText>Read to the study participant the following text:  Alert! If you have shoulder, elbow, or wrist pain, doing this test may aggravate your condition. The muscles of the upper body and shoulders are another frequently measured muscle group. Several tests (for example, pullup and pushup) are used to measure the strength and endurance of these muscle groups. Less muscular strength and endurance of the upper body and shoulder group may increase the chances that a person may have shoulder pain in middle or older adulthood. In the standard pushup test, you push your body up and down using muscles in your arms, shoulders and chest, while keeping your body straight with your feet serving as the pivot point. Your body weight is your workload. Females can reduce the load by having their knees touching the floor and acting as the pivot point. In this test, only the upper body is the load. We are going to use standard pushups and modified pushups as our tests for upper body and shoulder muscular strength and endurance (inst3_150201)</questionText>

        <questionText>Directions:   1. Males start in the standard pushup position (elevated). Hands should be shoulder width apart, arms extended straight out under the shoulders, back and legs in a straight line, and toes curled under. Females do a modified pushup with knees bent and touching the floor. Starting in the up position, hands should be slightly ahead of the shoulders so hands are in the proper position for the downward motion.   2. Lower until the chest is about 2 inches from the floor and rise up again.   3. Perform the test until you cannot complete any more pushups while keeping your back straight and, if you are a male, keeping the legs straight as well. The key to completing the test properly is to maintain a rigid position and keep the back flat. If necessary, you can take a brief rest in the up position (not lying on the floor).   4. Record your results. *Normative data for the pushup and modified pushup are based on a population that is 20 years of age and older.

        <questionText>Alert! If you have lowback pain, doing this test may aggravate your condition. Equipment/Test Setting: Tape measure or yardstick and tape and a partner to record your score. Directions:   1. Perform a series of static stretches. These stretches should focus on stretching the trunk and legs. Following the stretches, you may also want to do some brisk walking. 2. Place a yardstick on the floor and put a long piece of masking tape over the 15 inch mark at a right angle to the yardstick. Image of Sit and Reach exercise Remove your shoes and sit on the floor with the yardstick between the legs (0 mark close to your crotch), with your feet about 12 inches apart. Heels should be at the 14 inch mark at the start of the stretch to account for the fact that the legs tend to move forward when performing the stretch. 4. With the fingertips in contact with the yardstick, slowly stretch forward with both hands as far as possible noting where the fingertips are to the closest inch. Exhaling when you stretch forward and dropping the head may allow you to stretch a bit further. Do not use fast and sudden motions, which can injure your hamstring muscles.   5. Perform the stretch three times with a few seconds of rest between stretches.  6. Record the best of the three measurements. *Used with permission from Fitness Testing and Assessment Manual, 4th ed. © 2000 by YMCA of the USA, Chicago. All rights reserved.

    <preferredDefinition>This is a series of fitness tests used to assess a child's fitness level. Tests include the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER) test (similar to shuttle run); curl-up, which is often referred to as a sit-up; trunk lift; push-up (or modified push-up); and back-saver sit and reach. Optional tests include a 1 mile run/walk, modified pull-up or flexed arm hang (for muscular strength and endurance), and a shoulder stretch (for flexibility). Tests should be performed with the assistance of a partner who counts and/or times the activity.</preferredDefinition>

     <shortName>PX150203</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This is a series of fitness tests used to assess a child's fitness level. Tests include the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER) test (similar to shuttle run); curl-up, which is often referred to as a sit-up; trunk lift; push-up (or modified push-up); and back-saver sit and reach. Optional tests include a 1 mile run/walk, modified pull-up or flexed arm hang (for muscular strength and endurance), and a shoulder stretch (for flexibility). Tests should be performed with the assistance of a partner who counts and/or times the activity.</preferredDefinition>
