    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>A chest computed tomography (CT) is a non-invasive test that shows the size, shape, and structure of the lungs and other structures in the thorax. The chest CT scanning machine takes many pictures, called slices, of the lungs and the inside of the chest. A computer processes these pictures to be viewed on a monitor or printed on film. The computer can also stack the pictures to create a very detailed, three-dimensional (3D) model of the organs. This three-dimensional digital information can be used to measure the dimensions of the structure, such as the bronchial tree, or the density of the structure, such as the lung parenchyma. It is very important that the CT scanner used in any clinical research study be calibrated regularly against calibration standards that are provided by the manufacturer or in some instances by the study itself.</preferredDefinition>

     <preferredDefinition>A chest computed tomography (CT) is a non-invasive test that shows the size, shape, and structure of the lungs and other structures in the thorax. The chest CT scanning machine takes many pictures, called slices, of the lungs and the inside of the chest. A computer processes these pictures to be viewed on a monitor or printed on film. The computer can also stack the pictures to create a very detailed, three-dimensional (3D) model of the organs. This three-dimensional digital information can be used to measure the dimensions of the structure, such as the bronchial tree, or the density of the structure, such as the lung parenchyma. It is very important that the CT scanner used in any clinical research study be calibrated regularly against calibration standards that are provided by the manufacturer or in some instances by the study itself.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>The Tooth Surface Index of Fluorosis (TSIF) assesses dental fluorosis for each tooth surface. To obtain the Tooth Surface Index of Fluorosis (TSIF), each fully erupted, unrestored tooth surface is examined and assigned a score on a 0 to 7 scale noted below. This score is assigned to the anterior tooth Lower Left CI from the labial aspect. (dental_fluorosis_llci_labial_tsif)</questionText>
