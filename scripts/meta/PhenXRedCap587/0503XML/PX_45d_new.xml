    <longName>PhenX PX640103 - Classif Of Suicidal Ideation And Behadolescentsincel</longName>
    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the pediatric Since Last Visit from the Pediatric version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Since Last Visit version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality since the subject has begun taking part in a clinical trial and over his or her lifetime. This version is suitable to assess suicidality in subjects who have already been enrolled in a clinical trial but have not yet been assessed using the C-SSRS as part of the trial. This is useful for determining any effects that a particular treatment method may have had on suicidality.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>3. Subject endorses thoughts of suicide and has thought of at least one method during the assessment period. This is different than a specific plan with time, place or method details worked out (e.g., thought of method to kill self but not a specific plan).  Includes person who would say, "I thought about taking an overdose but I never made a specific plan as to when, where or how I would actually do it...and I would never go through with it."  Have you thought about how you would do that or how you would make yourself not alive anymore (kill yourself)? What did you think about?

        <questionText>4. Active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself and subject reports having some intent to act on such thoughts, as opposed to "I have the thoughts but I definitely will not do anything about them."

This is different from (as opposed to) having the thoughts but knowing you wouldn't do anything about it. (suicidalideation_withintent_withoutplan_sincelastvisit)</questionText>

        <questionText>Actual Attempt: A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Did you ever do anything to try to kill yourself or make yourself not alive anymore? What did you do?  Did you ever hurt yourself on purpose? Why did you do that?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to make yourself not alive anymore when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons, not at all to end your life or kill yourself (like to make yourself feel better, or get something else to happen)?

        <questionText>When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops themselves before they actually have engaged in any selfdestructive behavior. Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, except that the individual stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by something else.  Has there been a time when you started to do something to make yourself not alive anymore (end your life or kill yourself) but you changed your mind (stopped yourself) before you actually did anything? What did you do? (suicide_aborted_attempt_sincelastvisit)</questionText>

        <questionText>Preparatory Acts or Behavior: Acts or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a verbalization or thought, such as assembling a specific method (e.g., buying pills, purchasing a gun) or preparing for one's death by suicide (e.g., giving things away, writing a suicide note).  Have you done anything to get ready to make yourself not alive anymore (to end your life or kill yourself) like giving things away, writing a goodbye note, getting things you need to kill yourself?

     <longName>Classification of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior - Adolescent - Since Last Visit</longName>
     <context>PhenX</context>
     <shortName>PX640103</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the pediatric Since Last Visit from the Pediatric version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Since Last Visit version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality since the subject has begun taking part in a clinical trial and over his or her lifetime. This version is suitable to assess suicidality in subjects who have already been enrolled in a clinical trial but have not yet been assessed using the C-SSRS as part of the trial. This is useful for determining any effects that a particular treatment method may have had on suicidality.</preferredDefinition>
