    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Baseline version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating ScaleÂ© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Baseline version of the C-SSRS assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior. This version is suitable as part of a patient's first interview as part of a clinical study.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>3. Subject endorses thoughts of suicide and has thought of at least one method during the assessment period. This is different than a specific plan with time, place or method details worked out (e.g., thought of method to kill self but not a specific plan).  Includes person who would say, "I thought about taking an overdose but I never made a specific plan as to when, where or how I would actually do it....and I would never go through with it."  Have you thought about how you would do that or how you would make yourself not alive anymore (kill yourself)? What did you think about?

        <questionText>4. Active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself and subject reports having some intent to act on such thoughts, as opposed to "I have the thoughts but I definitely will not do anything about them."  When you thought about making yourself not alive anymore (or killing yourself), did you think that this was something you might actually do?  This is different from (as opposed to) having the thoughts but knowing you wouldn't do anything about it. (suicidalideation_withintent_withoutplan_lifetime)</questionText>

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Did you ever do anything to try to kill yourself or make yourself not alive anymore? What did you do?  Did you ever hurt yourself on purpose? Why did you do that?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to make yourself not alive anymore when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons, not at all to end your life or kill yourself (like to make yourself feel better, or get something else to happen)?

        <questionText>When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops themselves before they actually have engaged in any selfdestructive behavior. Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, except that the individual stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by something else.  Has there been a time when you started to do something to make yourself not alive anymore (end your life or kill yourself) but you changed your mind (stopped yourself) before you actually did anything?

     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Baseline version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating ScaleÂ© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Baseline version of the C-SSRS assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior. This version is suitable as part of a patient's first interview as part of a clinical study.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) for The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) is a 30-item semistructured interview that is used to make a current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to provide a continuous index of PTSD severity. It also can be used to assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. In addition to assessing DSM-IV PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, and impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and features of dissociation (depersonalization and derealization). Administration requires identification of an index traumatic event to serve as the basis for symptom inquiry. The "index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails id=630101" Life Events Checklist (LEC-5, substituting for LEC-IV) for The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is recommended prior to the Criterion A inquiry included in the CAPS-IV. Standardized questions and probes are provided for each symptom.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Scoring: It is recommended that the "1, 2" rule be used to determine a diagnosis that is, a frequency score of 1 (scale 0 = "none of the time" to 4 = "most or all of the time") and an intensity score of 2 (scale 0 = "none" to 4 = "extreme") is required for a particular symptom to meet criterion (Weathers et al., 1999). The diagnosis is then made according to the DSMIV algorithm:  At least one Criterion B symptom, At least three Criterion C symptoms, At least two Criterion D symptoms,  Criterion A is met,  Criterion E is met, and  Criterion F is met. A severity score for each symptom is calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores, which can then be summed for all 17 symptom questions and/or for the three symptom clusters.
