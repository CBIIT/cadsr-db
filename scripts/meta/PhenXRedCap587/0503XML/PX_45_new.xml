    <preferredDefinition>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) for The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) is a 30-item semistructured interview that is used to make a current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to provide a continuous index of PTSD severity. It also can be used to assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. In addition to assessing DSM-IV PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, and impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and features of dissociation (depersonalization and derealization). Administration requires identification of an index traumatic event to serve as the basis for symptom inquiry. The "index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails id=630101" Life Events Checklist (LEC-5, substituting for LEC-IV) for The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is recommended prior to the Criterion A inquiry included in the CAPS-IV. Standardized questions and probes are provided for each symptom.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Scoring: It is recommended that the "1, 2" rule be used to determine a diagnosis that is, a frequency score of 1 (scale 0 = "none of the time" to 4 = "most or all of the time") and an intensity score of 2 (scale 0 = "none" to 4 = "extreme") is required for a particular symptom to meet criterion (Weathers et al., 1999). The diagnosis is then made according to the DSMIV algorithm:  At least one Criterion B symptom, At least three Criterion C symptoms, At least two Criterion D symptoms,  Criterion A is met,  Criterion E is met, and  Criterion F is met. A severity score for each symptom is calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores, which can then be summed for all 17 symptom questions and/or for the three symptom clusters.

        <questionText>Changes to CAPS for DSM5 (compared to CAPS for DSMIV) CAPS for DSMIV asked respondents to endorse up to three traumatic events to keep in mind during the interview. CAPS5 requires the identification of a single index trauma to serve as the basis of symptom inquiry. CAPS5 is a 30item interview, corresponding to the DSM5 diagnosis for PTSD. The language of the CAPS5 reflects changes to the definition of the traumatic event (Criterion A), changes to existing symptoms, and the addition of new symptoms in DSM5. CAPS5 asks questions relevant to assessing the dissociative subtype of PTSD (depersonalization and derealization), but no longer includes other associated symptoms (e.g., gaps in awareness). As with previous versions of the CAPS, CAPS5 symptom severity ratings are based on symptom frequency and intensity (except for amnesia and diminished interest which are based on amount and intensity). However, CAPS5 items are rated with a single severity score in contrast to previous versions of the CAPS, which required separate frequency and intensity scores. General instructions and scoring information are included with the CAPS5. (changes_630402)</questionText>

        <questionText>Sample Item: In the past month, have you had any unwanted memories of (EVENT) while you were awake, so not counting dreams? How does it happen that you start remembering (EVENT)? [If not clear:] (Are these unwanted memories, or are you thinking about [EVENT] on purpose?) How much do these memories bother you? Are you able to put them out of your mind and thing about something else? How often have you had these memories in the past month? # of times ______. Severity Rating: 0. Absent: The respondent denied the problem of the respondent's report doesn't fit the DSM5 symptom criterion. 1. Mild/subthreshold: The respondent described a problem that is consistent with the symptom criterion but isn't severe enough to be considered clinically significant. The problem doesn't satisfy the DSM5 symptom criterion and thus doesn't count toward a PTSD diagnosis. 2. Moderate/threshold: The respondent described a clinically significant problem. The problem satisfies the DSM5 symptom criterion and thus counts toward a PTSD diagnosis. The problem would be a target for intervention. This rating requires a minimum frequency of 2 x month or some of the time (2030%) PLUS a minimum intensity of Clearly Present. 3. Severe/markedly elevated: The respondent described a problem that is above threshold. The problem is difficult to manage and at times overwhelming, and would be a prominent target for intervention. This rating requires a minimum frequency of 2 x week or much of the time (5060%) PLUS a minimum intensity of Pronounced. 4. Extreme/incapacitating: The respondent described a dramatic symptom, far above threshold. The problem is pervasive, unmanageable, and overwhelming, and would be a highpriority target for intervention. (sample_630402)</questionText>

        <questionText>Scoring: Detailed scoring information is included with the CAPS5 and should be reviewed carefully before administering. Briefly, the assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM5 PTSD symptoms. Similarly, CAPS5 symptom cluster severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item severity scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM5 cluster: Criterion B (items 15) Criterion C (items 67) Criterion D (items 814) and, Criterion E (items 1520). A symptom cluster score may also be calculated for dissociation by summing items 19 and 20. PTSD diagnostic status is determent by first dichotomizing each symptom as "present" or "absent," then following the DSM5 diagnostic rule. A symptom is considered present only if the corresponding item severity score is rated 2 ("moderate/threshold") or higher. The DSM5 PTSD diagnostic rule requires: At least one Criterion B symptom  At least one Criterion C symptom At least two Criterion D symptoms At least two Criterion E symptoms Criterion F is met (disturbance has lasted one month)Criterion G is met (disturbance cause either clinically significant distress or functional impairment) (scoring_630402)</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey is a self-administered questionnaire that that includes 19 items across four functional support subscales: emotional/informational support (8 items), tangible/instrumental support (4 items), affectionate support (3 items), and positive social interaction (3 items). Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert style scale (1 = None of the Time; 5 = All of the Time) to indicate how often that type of support is available to them. A score for each social support subscale can be computed by averaging across the individual items or by adding scores individual items together. Higher scores indicate more support.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>The General Well Being Schedule (GWB) is an 18-item, self-administered questionnaire that was developed for the U.S. Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HANES I). The GWB includes positive and negative questions across six dimensions: positive well-being, self-control, vitality, depression, anxiety, and general health. Each item has the time frame "during the last month," and the first 14 questions use 6-point response scales representing intensity or frequency. The remaining four questions use 0-10 rating scales defined by adjectives at each end. The polarity of items 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 16 is reversed for scoring, and items within each subscale are added together. Lower scores reflect distress and higher scores reflect positive well-being.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Scoring: Items 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 16 are reverse scored. The scores from all items are added together and 14 are subtracted from the total to give a range of 0110. There are three proposed cutpoints: total scores of 060 reflect "severe distress," 6172 "moderate distress," and 73110 "positive wellbeing". Six subscores can be derived. Subscore Label  Question topics. Anxiety: 2. nervousness 5. strain, stress, or pressure 8. anxious, worried, upset16. relaxed, tense Depression: 4. sad, discouraged, hopeless 12. downhearted, blue 18. depressed Positive wellbeing: 1. feeling in general 6. happy, satisfied with life 11. interesting daily life Selfcontrol: 3. firm control of behavior, emotions 7. afraid losing mind, or losing control 13. emotionally stable, sure of self  Vitality: 9. waking fresh, rested 14. feeling tired, worn out 17. energy level General health: 10. bothered by illness 15. concerned, worried about health (scoring_630701)</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>The General Well Being Schedule (GWB) is an 18-item, self-administered questionnaire that was developed for the U.S. Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HANES I). The GWB includes positive and negative questions across six dimensions: positive well-being, self-control, vitality, depression, anxiety, and general health. Each item has the time frame "during the last month," and the first 14 questions use 6-point response scales representing intensity or frequency. The remaining four questions use 0-10 rating scales defined by adjectives at each end. The polarity of items 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 16 is reversed for scoring, and items within each subscale are added together. Lower scores reflect distress and higher scores reflect positive well-being.</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>The Baseline and Trauma Challenge Psychophysiological Recordings protocol consists of a Baseline phase and a Trauma Challenge (trauma interview and trauma imagery) phase. During the baseline phase, skin conductance and heart rate are monitored continuously for 5 minutes while the participant rests quietly without talking. During the first part of the Trauma Challenge, heart rate and skin conductance are continuously measured while the participant is administered a 21-question, open-ended trauma interview. After the interview, skin conductance and heart rate are monitored continuously for 60 seconds while the participant is asked to think about and imagine the traumatic event. Derived scores include average skin conductance and heart rate calculated for baseline, trauma interview, and trauma imagery as well as the difference in heart rate and skin conductance between (1) trauma interview and baseline, (2) trauma imagery and baseline, and (3-5) the first and last minutes within each measurement period (baseline, trauma interview, and trauma imagery).</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>TRAUMA INTERVIEW (Adapted from Standardized Trauma Interview, Foa and Rothbaum, 1998)  Start recording data and ask the following questions: 1. Please briefly describe the event that happened to you 2. What time of day did it happen? 3. Where did it happen? 4. How long did this event last? That is, how long was it from the moment you first felt like you were in danger until you felt safe again? 5. How long ago did it happen? 6. How much have you slept since it happened? 7. What is your relationship with the perpetrator (if applicable)? 8. Was anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol when it happened? 9. Was anyone else with you? 10. Did you have any injuries? What were they? 11. Do you anticipate longterm physical problems as a result of this event? 12. Was anyone else injured? 13. Was anyone killed? 14. Did you see other people's injury or death? 15. At the time of the incident, did you think you would be seriously injured or killed? 16. During the event, how helpless did you feel? 17. During the event, how horrified or shocked did you feel? 18. During the event, how terrified or afraid did you feel? 19. During the event, how much control did you feel? 20. Have you ever experienced a similar event before? 21. How many times?

     <preferredDefinition>The Baseline and Trauma Challenge Psychophysiological Recordings protocol consists of a Baseline phase and a Trauma Challenge (trauma interview and trauma imagery) phase. During the baseline phase, skin conductance and heart rate are monitored continuously for 5 minutes while the participant rests quietly without talking. During the first part of the Trauma Challenge, heart rate and skin conductance are continuously measured while the participant is administered a 21-question, open-ended trauma interview. After the interview, skin conductance and heart rate are monitored continuously for 60 seconds while the participant is asked to think about and imagine the traumatic event. Derived scores include average skin conductance and heart rate calculated for baseline, trauma interview, and trauma imagery as well as the difference in heart rate and skin conductance between (1) trauma interview and baseline, (2) trauma imagery and baseline, and (3-5) the first and last minutes within each measurement period (baseline, trauma interview, and trauma imagery).</preferredDefinition>

    <changeNote>Uploaded via FormLoader</changeNote>
    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Current version of the C-SSRS assesses during predefined time periods-ideation in past 6 months and suicidal behavior over the adolescent's lifetime. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Actual Attempt:  A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. (actual_attempt)</questionText>

        <questionText>Interrupted Attempt: When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially selfinjurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred). Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting. Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hangis stopped from doing so (interrupted_attempt_640101)</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Screening version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Current version of the C-SSRS assesses during predefined time periods-ideation in past 6 months and suicidal behavior over the adolescent's lifetime. This version is meant to assess patient eligibility based on study-defined suicidality inclusion/exclusion criteria or assess current severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>3. Subject endorses thoughts of suicide and has thought of at least one method during the assessment period. This is different than a specific plan with time, place or method details worked out (e.g., thought of method to kill self but not a specific plan).  Includes person who would say, "I thought about taking an overdose but I never made a specific plan as to when, where or how I would actually do it....and I would never go through with it."  Have you thought about how you would do that or how you would make yourself not alive anymore (kill yourself)? What did you think about?

        <questionText>4. Active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself and subject reports having some intent to act on such thoughts, as opposed to "I have the thoughts but I definitely will not do anything about them."  When you thought about making yourself not alive anymore (or killing yourself), did you think that this was something you might actually do?  This is different from (as opposed to) having the thoughts but knowing you wouldn't do anything about it. (suicidalideation_withintent_withoutplan_lifetime)</questionText>

        <questionText>A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Did you ever do anything to try to kill yourself or make yourself not alive anymore? What did you do?  Did you ever hurt yourself on purpose? Why did you do that?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to make yourself not alive anymore when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons, not at all to end your life or kill yourself (like to make yourself feel better, or get something else to happen)?

        <questionText>Acts or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a verbalization or thought, such as assembling a specific method (e.g., buying pills, purchasing a gun) or preparing for one's death by suicide (e.g., giving things away, writing a suicide note).  Have you done anything to get ready to make yourself not alive anymore (to end your life or kill yourself) like giving things away, writing a goodbye note, getting things you need to kill yourself?

     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the Pediatric Baseline version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Pediatric Baseline version of the C-SSRS assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior. This version is suitable as part of a patient's first interview as part of a clinical study.</preferredDefinition>

    <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the pediatric Since Last Visit from the Pediatric version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Since Last Visit version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality since the subject has begun taking part in a clinical trial and over his or her lifetime. This version is suitable to assess suicidality in subjects who have already been enrolled in a clinical trial but have not yet been assessed using the C-SSRS as part of the trial. This is useful for determining any effects that a particular treatment method may have had on suicidality.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>Actual Attempt: A potentially selfinjurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Did you ever do anything to try to kill yourself or make yourself not alive anymore? What did you do?  Did you ever hurt yourself on purpose? Why did you do that?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to make yourself not alive anymore when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?  Or did you do it purely for other reasons, not at all to end your life or kill yourself (like to make yourself feel better, or get something else to happen)?

     <context>PhenX</context>
     <shortName>PX640103</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>This protocol includes two subscales from the pediatric Since Last Visit from the Pediatric version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale© (C-SSRS): Severity of Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. Both subscales provide definitions of suicidal ideation and behavior and corresponding probes. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal, self-injurious behavior. The Since Last Visit version of the C-SSRS assesses suicidality since the subject has begun taking part in a clinical trial and over his or her lifetime. This version is suitable to assess suicidality in subjects who have already been enrolled in a clinical trial but have not yet been assessed using the C-SSRS as part of the trial. This is useful for determining any effects that a particular treatment method may have had on suicidality.</preferredDefinition>
