Most obstetric practices and prenatal clinics use a standardized form to chart prenatal course. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG, formerly the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) has an Antenatal Record form that is periodically upgraded and available for its members. There are others, such as the POPRAS (Problem Oriented Perinatal Risk Assessment System) forms, which are also in common use. All of the standardized forms have places or spaces to report information on gestational age, pre-pregnancy weight, height, and weights measured during pregnancy at every prenatal visit and dates of examination. For women carrying a singleton fetus, the expected schedule of prenatal visits suggested by ACOG is monthly through the 7th month (28 weeks), every 2-3 weeks through the 9th month (36 weeks), and weekly thereafter until delivery.

Total gestational weight gain is calculated by subtracting the pre-pregnancy weight from the weight at the final prenatal visit, usually within a week of delivery. Weight is occasionally measured at delivery and can be used for this calculation if membranes are still intact at the time of weighing. The weight at delivery can be found in the labor and delivery chart along with the gestational age at delivery.

The information to be abstracted from the records would be a) weight at final prenatal visit (to the nearest 100 g, e.g., 59.1 kg); b) date of final visit; c) pre-pregnancy weight; d) height; e) gestational age at final visit; f) gestational age at delivery.",,PX021302,,,,,,,,,,
