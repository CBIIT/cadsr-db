instructions40201,phenx_lipid_profile,,descriptive,"If the respondent answers ""yes"" to question 1, then the interviewer will proceed to question 2. The use of lipid-lowering medications must be captured, as the use of medications can have profound and predictable effects on the lipid levels and obscure the levels and phenotype of hyperlipidemia. Lipid profiles involving triglyceride-level measurement should be collected after an 8-12 hour fast. Generally, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides should be measured in a laboratory that is certified and referenced to a regional reference laboratory.",,PX040201,,,,,,,,,,
