Record on form whether infant is weighed with a study blanket. Note: If the infant urinates in the blanket, repeat the measurement using a dry blanket. ´Place the infant on the scale so that weight is distributed equally about the center of the pan.´Record the weight on form.´Remove the infant from the scale, then replace and weigh a second time.´Record the second weight on form.´If the difference in the two weights is greater than 100 grams, obtain a third measurement.´Note the weight of the blanket and subtract the weight of the blanket from the total weight of the infant plus blanket to estimate birth weight of the infant.",text,"weight at birth measurement 1, in gram",,PX020202,number,0.1,4000,,[weight_measured_in_gram] = '1',,,,,
