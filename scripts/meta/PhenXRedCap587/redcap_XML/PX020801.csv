hip_circumference_desc,phenx_hip_circumference,,descriptive,"Participant should be wearing an examination gown when these measures are taken.

The hip girth measurement should be made on the participant’s right side (rather than in front) with the patient’s feet together.

Hip girth is measured at the level of the symphysis pubis anteriorly and posteriorly at the level of the maximal protrusion of the gluteal muscles (Exhibit 1). This level usually is the greatest circumference of the hips (but not always). Keep the anthropometric tape horizontal at this level and record the measurement to the nearest 0.5 cm.

Rounding rule: If measuring to the nearest half centimeter, round according to the following example: 86.1 and 86.2 would round to 86.0; 86.3, 86.4, 86.6, and 86.7 would round to 86.5; 86.8 and 86.9 would round to 87.0. Measures of 87.0 and 87.5 should be recorded as such.

The greatest source of error for this measurement is due to not having the tape horizontal. If the participant is large, it is permissible to have him/her hold one end of the tape while walking the tape around for this measurement.

NOTE: For large participants, two technicians will be required to perform the measurement. Take care not to offend the person being measured; be as discreet as possible when changing to the larger tape measure.",,PX020801,,,,,,,,,,
