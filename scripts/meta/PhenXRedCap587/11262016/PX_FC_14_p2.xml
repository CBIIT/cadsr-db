    <preferredDefinition>Hand grip strength is measured with a device called a hand-held dynamometer. The technician follows a script and asks the participant about hand surgery or pain that may influence the results. The technician asks the participant to sit in a chair and rest his/her arm on the table with the elbow on top of a mouse pad and arm held at a right angle. The technician adjusts the grip size of the dynamometer to the participant’s hand size and explains how the device works. The participant stands for the measures if possible. The participant squeezes the dynamometer twice during practice trials. Now, starting with the right hand, the participant is asked to squeeze as hard as possible. Three trials are attempted with each hand, with all results recorded on a form. The sum of the greatest effort (number) for each hand is the measurement used. Results should be recorded to the nearest 2 kilograms.</preferredDefinition>

The QC screens indicate the tolerance ranges. The dynamometer calibration can be conducted in the body measures room for convenience.  1. Set out all items needed for calibration out and place them within reach.  2. Pick one dynamometer to be used during the stand and one to be the backup. Calibrate the dynamometer that will be used first.  3. Turn the sitting box upside down so that the open hole is facing up.  4. Sit the hanging base weight in the center of the bottom of the box (Figure 3). (The center is marked.)</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 4. Positioning the dynamometer for calibration 9. When you are ready to begin hanging the weights on the dynamometer handle, ask someone to assist you. The other person will need to keep the hanging base from moving as you add the weights to it. When picking up a weight, grab it by the indentation located on each side of the weight (Figure 5). NOTE: The person holding the hanging bases in place should be careful not to pull down on the base. The dynamometer reading only goes up. Pulling down on the hanging base can give you a false reading.</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 7. Weights hanging from the dynamometer handle  13. The reading must fall between 913 kg. This is ± 2 kg of the slotted weight (10 kg) plus the weight of the base (1 kg).  If the reading falls within the range, record it. If the reading does not fall within the range, follow the troubleshooting tips. 14. After recording the reading, add another 10 kg slotted weight to the stem by following the procedures in steps 10 and 11. There will be a total of 2 1 kg weights hanging from the dynamometer. The second reading should fall within the range of 1923 kg If the measurement falls within the range, record the reading. If the reading does not fall within the range, follow the troubleshooting tips. 15. After recording the second reading, add two more 10 kg weights to the base in the same manner indicated in steps 10 and 11. There will now be a total of 41 kgs of weight hanging from the dynamometer. The third reading should fall within the range of 3943 kg. If the measurement falls within the range, record the reading. If the reading does not fall within the range, follow the troubleshooting tips. 16. After recording the final reading, carefully remove the slotted weights and the base from the handle and turn the dynamometer off. Do not leave the weights hanging from the handle any longer than absolutely necessary.  17. Calibrate the backup dynamometer in the same manner (steps 416). When recording the readings for the backup dynamometer, write the date of calibration and the serial number of the dynamometer somewhere on the paper.  18. Store all calibration items. (Put the calibration weights back in the cardboard boxes before storing them.)  19. Turn the sitting box over and return it to its proper place.  20. Enter the calibration readings for the dynamometer that will be used during the stand into ISIS.  21. Put the calibration readings for the backup dynamometer in the carrying case with the backup dynamometer and store it in the cabinet in the TRUNCATED</questionText>

        <questionText>If any measurements for any weights are outside of the tolerance range, take all the weights off the handle and turn the dynamometer off. Turn the dynamometer back on, perform the procedure again for that weight, and verify if the result is in the acceptable range. Check the positioning of the slotted weight on the base. The stem of the base should be flush with the back of the weight's slot and centered. The position of the weight will affect the reading. If the result is still outside of the acceptable range, take all the weights off the handle, turn the dynamometer off, and then notify the team leader. If the team leader cannot get the reading within its acceptable range, calibrate and use the backup dynamometer. A dynamometer cannot be used if it does not calibrate properly.</questionText>

The SP will remain seated during the preparation and warmup.Ask the SP to remove hand and wrist jewelry. Hand and wrist jewelry could interfere with the SP's ability to grip the dynamometer or become damaged from squeezing the dynamometer. To prevent damaging the SP's jewelry, ask the SP to remove hand and wrist jewelry and place it in the small plastic container on the counter. If the SP does not want to remove his or her jewelry, the test will still continue.To loosen up the hands and fingers, the SP will complete two warmup exercises. The warmup exercises include shaking both hands three times and bending and stretching all fingers three times. Demonstrate each exercise and ask the SP to do the exercise</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 12. Checking angle of index finger  If the second joint of the SP's index finger cannot bend enough to achieve the 90 degree angle for any reason (i.e., arthritis, long nails, large or small hand), adjust the grip size to be as close to the 90 degree angle as you can and proceed with the exam. On the pretest screen, indicate whether or not the SP was able to bend his or her index finger to achieve the 90 degree angle  If the SP was not able to achieve a 90 degree angle at the second joint of the index finger, specify the hand (right, left, or both) in the dropdown box and enter the reason why in the "Comments" field (i.e., both hands too small, both hands too large, R arthritis, L nails too long). Record any additional comments regarding the SP's hand or fingers in the "Comments" field (Exhibits 34). Use the following abbreviations to record your comments:  R: right hand  use capitalized letter "R" to refer to the right hand  L: left hand  use capitalized letter "L" to refer to the left hand D: digit  use 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, and 5D to refer thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and pinky, respectively  P: phalange  For example, "missing 1P in L2D" means "missing 1 phalange in the index finger on left hand." After the grip size is adjusted for the first test hand, put the dynamometer in the opposite hand in the same manner. This will be the practice hand. Check the grip to see if the same grip size fits both hands. Most of the time, the grip size will be the same for both hands. If the grip size is not the same for both hands, follow the guidelines below to make adjustments: Use the wet erase pen to mark the placement of the handle for the first hand. The mark should be made on the back of the dynamometer inline with the indicator mark on the handle (Figure 13). Adjust the grip size for the second hand (the practice hand). Mark the handle placement for the second hand. Proceed with the demonstration. Make proper adjustments for each TRUNCATED</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 13. Proper marking of the handle placement The SP will only perform the exam in the seated position if he or she cannot stand unassisted (see section for individuals who cannot stand unassisted). Record if the SP will stand or sit for the exam on the pretest screen. If the exam will be completed in a sitting position, the system will prompt you to indicate whether either of the SP's feet can apply force to the ground. If it is not obvious, check the SP's leg function by placing your hand under the SP's foot/feet and ask the SP to apply force to your hand. The test will still continue regardless of the SP's leg function however, this information is important for data analysis. Tech Demonstration of Exam After the grip size is adjusted, take the dynamometer from the SP and explain the exam to the SP using the suggested scripts below. During the demonstration, the SP can remain sitting while you stand to demonstrate. SUGGESTED SCRIPT:  For the test, I will ask you to squeeze this hand grip as hard as you can. You will stand with your feet hip width apart and your toes pointing forward like this. You will hold your hand so that it's not touching your body and squeeze the handle. I want you to stand tall and try not to lean when you squeeze. You will take a breath in, then blow out while you squeeze. You will squeeze as hard as you can until you can't squeeze any harder. Like this. (Do the squeeze demo now.) We will test each hand 3 times. While explaining the test to the SP, demonstrate the test as indicated below.  Grasp the dynamometer between the fingers and the palm at the base of the thumb.  Hold the dynamometer in line with the forearm at the thigh level so that it's not touching the body.  Emphasize that the SP should stand with the feet hip width apart with toes pointing forward.  Instruct the SP that neither the hand nor dynamometer should touch the body or any other object during the test.  Instruct the SP not to hold his or her breath. TRUNCATED</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 15. Arm position for seated exam  Start the Exam After the practice trial is completed and the SP understands the test, you are ready to begin the exam. For the exam, each hand will be tested three times, alternating hands between trials with a 60second rest between measurements on the same hand. The order of the tests is randomized by the SP's ID number and the SP's dominant hand (i.e., odd number ID starts with his or her dominant hand even number ID starts with his or her nondominant hand people with unidentifiable dominant hand randomly assigned by ID). Always double check the testing position before each test. SPs often move their feet between each test so it is important to double check the SP's feet each time. Press the "ON/C" button (Figure 16) on the dynamometer before the start of each test. This will reset the dynamometer reading to zero and disable the dynamometer from calculating and display the average grip strength reading automatically. For each test, once the SP finishes squeezing, take the dynamometer from the SP and enter the reading into the computer application. The 60second timer on the screen will start to countdown. Do not return the dynamometer to the SP until all 60 seconds have elapsed. Remember to set the dynamometer to zero by pressing the "ON/C" button prior to returning it to the SP</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 16. Dynamometer "ON/C" button    Reminder: If the SP's grip size was different between their two hands, you will need to adjust the handle size each time based on the marks you made earlier.  Coaching the SP When the SP is squeezing the dynamometer, encourage him or her by using a neutral, instructive, and upbeat tone. The SP will squeeze the dynamometer as hard as possible. Instruct the SP by saying: Suggested Script: When I say "squeeze," squeeze as hard as you can until you can't squeeze any harder. Remember to blow out when you squeeze.READY, TAKE A BREATH IN, LET IT OUT, SQUEEZE!SQUEEZE AS HARD AS YOU CAN UNTIL YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE ANY HARDER.After the first squeeze, do not repeat the entire coaching script unless it is necessary. For subsequent squeezes, say:READY, TAKE A BREATH IN, LET IT OUT, SQUEEZE  SQUEEZE AS HARD AS YOU CAN UNTIL YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE ANY HARDER. SPs may have different coaching needs. It is acceptable to adjust your coaching accordingly. For example, if the SP is holding his or her breath or starting to lean while squeezing, you may need to remind the SP to breathe out or to stand tall. Record the results into the data collection instrument. Remove batteries from dynamometers when finished for the day. Unusual Testing Situations  If an SP cannot stand up completely straight (i.e., osteoporosis), the exam will continue if this is normal for the SP. The SP will stand as straight as possible. If the SP bends or twists his or her body while squeezing the dynamometer (Figure 17), do not record the results. Illustrate again the proper position to the SP and repeat the measurement. If this is the first test of the exam, change the starting hand field and start the exam on the other hand. Use the digital timer to make sure you wait 60 seconds before testing the hand again. If this is not the first test, move on and test the opposite hand, then come back and repeat the measurement. It is important to wait 60 seconds between measurementsTRUNCATED</questionText>

        <questionText>Figure 17. Positioning mistakes  Some SPs may experience pain due to arthritis or tendonitis when squeezing the dynamometer. Make sure the pain is not caused by inappropriate grip size or grip position. Encourage the SP to complete the exam. Grip strength test is a common functional assessment that is routinely used in clinical setting for arthritis, tendonitis, or carpal tunnel syndrome patients. There should be no more than minimal risk associated with the grip test. If the SP experiences pain when squeezing the dynamometer and cannot continue the test, stop the test on that hand. If the dynamometer is dropped, swap it out for another dynamometer.</questionText>

     <preferredDefinition>Hand grip strength is measured with a device called a hand-held dynamometer. The technician follows a script and asks the participant about hand surgery or pain that may influence the results. The technician asks the participant to sit in a chair and rest his/her arm on the table with the elbow on top of a mouse pad and arm held at a right angle. The technician adjusts the grip size of the dynamometer to the participant’s hand size and explains how the device works. The participant stands for the measures if possible. The participant squeezes the dynamometer twice during practice trials. Now, starting with the right hand, the participant is asked to squeeze as hard as possible. Three trials are attempted with each hand, with all results recorded on a form. The sum of the greatest effort (number) for each hand is the measurement used. Results should be recorded to the nearest 2 kilograms.</preferredDefinition>

        <questionText>The participant must be able to stand unassisted without the use of a cane or walker. You may help the participant to get up. Now let's begin the evaluation. I would now like you to try to move your body in different movements. I will first describe and show each movement to you. Then I'd like you to try to do it. If you cannot do a particular movement, or if you feel it would be unsafe to try to do it, tell me and we'll move on to the next one. Let me emphasize that I do not want you to try to do any exercise that you feel might be unsafe. Do you have any questions before we begin? A. SidebySide Stand  1. Now I will show you the first movement. 2. (Demonstrate) I want you to try to stand with your feet together, sidebyside, for about 10 seconds. 3. You may use your arms, bend your knees, or move your body to maintain your balance, but try not to move your feet. Try to hold this position until I tell you to stop. 4. Stand next to the participant to help him/her into the sidebyside position. 5. Supply just enough support to the participant's arm to prevent loss of balance. 6. When the participant has his/her feet together, ask "Are you ready?" 7. Then let go and begin timing as you say, "Ready, begin." 8. Stop the stopwatch and say "Stop" after 10 seconds or when the participant steps out of position or grabs your arm. 9. If participant is unable to hold the position for 10 seconds, record result and go to the gait speed test.</questionText>

        <questionText>1. Now I will show you the third movement.2. (Demonstrate) Now I want you to try to stand with the heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of the other foot for about 10 seconds. You may put either foot in front, whichever is more comfortable for you.3. You may use your arms, bend your knees, or move your body to maintain your balance, but try not to move your feet. Try to hold this position until I tell you to stop.4. Stand next to the participant to help him/her into the tandem position.5. Supply just enough support to the participant's arm to prevent loss of balance.6. When the participant has his/her feet together, ask "Are you ready?"7. Then let go and begin timing as you say, "Ready, begin."8. Stop the stopwatch and say "Stop" after 10 seconds or when the participant steps out of position or grabs your arm.</questionText>

        <questionText>Have a look at the questions. These questions are about things you do while either sitting or lying. Using a computer for fun includes emailing, chat rooms, blogs, surfing the net and egames. Being tutored means any additional academic tutoring or coaching you may get outside of school hours. Hobbies and crafts also include things like card and board games. Include texting, while sitting around  but only if you are sitting and texting, not walking and texting. Saturday School means going to community classes for either cultural or religious instruction. What we would like you to do in a moment is think about a NORMAL school week and write down how much time you spend doing the following activities before and after school each day Monday to Friday). You can write hours and/or minutes. The reason we are asking about every day of the week is because you might do different things on different days. What time do you wake up and go to school? What time do you usually get home from school? What time do you usually go to bed? Think about how many hours there are in between these times. It's what you do during this time that we are asking about in the weekdays' question. If you do two activities at the same time, say, doing your homework in front of the TV for an hour, then write down how much time you spent on each of these activities, for example, 45 minutes watching TV and 15 minutes on your homework. Don't double up the time! (Researcher to do example question before class starts completing questionnaire.) Before you start, let's look at the first question together. The first line of this question looks at how much TV you watch during the week, before and after school. So what you will need to do in a moment is write down the amount of time in numbers in the boxes. We would prefer that you write minutes, but you can write in hours if need be. For example: if I watch one and a half hours of TV on a Monday night, I would put either 90 (minutes) or 1 TRUNCATED</questionText>

        <questionText>Data from the questionnaire is used to determine frequency per week and estimated caloric expenditure per week from physical activity. Separate scores are derived for physical activities of moderate or greater intensity (metabolic equivalents MET ? 3.0) and for all specified activities including those of light and moderate or greater intensity. For each of these, scores are calculated for frequency per week and estimated caloric expenditure per week. Estimated caloric expenditures were calculated by multiplying the estimated duration per week by the MET value for each activity and summing across all relevant activities. Frequency per week is calculated by summing the frequency per week across all relevant activities. Detailed formulas are found in Table A1. MET values were assigned to each activity from the values reported by Ainsworth et al. 1993. If an activity did not appear in the Ainsworth et al. compendium, the activity was assigned a value based on similar activities. The MET values for CHAMPS activities appear in Table A2*.*Table A2 may be found in the Appendix of the following source. Stewart, A. L., Mills, K. M., King, A. C., Haskell, W. L., Gillis, D.,Ritter, P. L. (2001). CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Adults: Outcomes for Interventions. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 33(7), 11261141.

     <shortName>PX150703</shortName>
     <preferredDefinition>The participant is asked to recall physical activities he/she engaged in during the last 4 weeks. The self-administered questionnaire addresses specific activities and asks whether the person has engaged in the activity. If the participant has engaged in the activity, he/she is instructed to answer how many times a week and how many hours total in the week. The Community Health Activity Models Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) codebook is used to score the results and determine the calories expended per week and hours per week engaged in physical activity.</preferredDefinition>
