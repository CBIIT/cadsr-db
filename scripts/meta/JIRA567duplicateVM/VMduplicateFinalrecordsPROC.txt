
The duplicate VMs cleanup process 
involves insert/modification records in existing 4 tables:

SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS
SBR.DESIGNATIONS
SBR.DEFINITIONS
SBREXT.AC_ATT_CSCSI_EXT

For the duplicate VMs cleanup process  were created

4 tables in SBREXT schema 
SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF --to keep truck of final and dup records
SBREXT.MDSR_DUP_VM_ERR  --to keep truck of errors
SBREXT.MDSR_SYNONYMS_XML --to load webservise XML respond
SBREXT.MDSR_CONCEPTS_SYNONYMS  --to load concept names and synonyms

6 Stored Procedures and 1 function in SBREXT schema

Procedures DESCRIPTION 

Table SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF is created as  across reference table between final and retired SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS duplicate records
marked by the duplicate VMs cleanup process.

Table SBREXT.MDSR_DUP_VM_ERR is created to store reasons of failures of the process.

First step of SP SBREXT.MDSR_CREATE_VM_DUP_REF

The SP SBREXT.MDSR_CREATE_VM_DUP_REF finds 3 group of sets of VM duplicate records


1.duplicate VMs with Concepts(CONDR_IDSEQ is NOT NULL) but Concepts Name not like "integer".
   The records in these sets are grouped by VM CONDR_IDSEQ and VM Long_NAME=CONCEPT_NAME or it's SYNONYM.

 1.First insert records  where VM Long_NAME=CONCEPT_NAME :
INSERT INTO SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
(FIN_VM,FIN_IDSEQ ,VM_ID,VM_IDSEQ,CONCEPTS_CODE,CONCEPTS_NAME,LONG_NAME,CONDR_IDSEQ, PROC )
 select   FIN_VM ,VM_IDSEQ FIN_IDSEQ,VM_ID,VM_IDSEQ,name CONCEPTS_CODE,CONCEPT_NAME,VM_NAME,CONDR_IDSEQ,'FINAL' from
(
select  max(VM_ID) over  (partition by CONDR_IDSEQ order by CONDR_IDSEQ ) as FIN_VM 
,VM_ID,VM_NAME,CONCEPT_NAME,CONDR_IDSEQ,VM_IDSEQ ,name from
(
select VM_ID,VM_IDSEQ,VM.LONG_NAME VM_NAME,CN.LONG_NAME CONCEPT_NAME,VM.CONDR_IDSEQ,name
from SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS VM,
SBREXT.CON_DERIVATION_RULES_EXT DER,
SBREXT.CONCEPTS_EXT CN,
(
 select COUNT(*),CONDR_IDSEQ from SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS VM
 where   UPPER(ASL_NAME) not like '%RETIRED%' AND CONDR_IDSEQ is not null
 GROUP BY CONDR_IDSEQ HAVING COUNT(*)>1
 )DUP
 where   VM.CONDR_IDSEQ=DER.CONDR_IDSEQ
 AND VM.CONDR_IDSEQ=DUP.CONDR_IDSEQ
 and DER.NAME=CN.PREFERRED_NAME
 AND UPPER(VM.ASL_NAME) not like '%RETIRED%'
 AND TRIM(UPPER(VM.LONG_NAME)) =TRIM(UPPER(CN.LONG_NAME))
 AND instr(DER.NAME,'C45255')=0
 ))
 where FIN_VM=VM_ID
 UNION
  select   FIN_VM ,VM_IDSEQ FIN_IDSEQ,VM_ID,VM_IDSEQ,name CONCEPTS_CODE,CONCEPT_NAME,VM_NAME,CONDR_IDSEQ,'FINAL' from
(
select  max(VM_ID) over  (partition by CONDR_IDSEQ order by CONDR_IDSEQ ) as FIN_VM 
,VM_ID,VM_NAME,CONCEPT_NAME,name,CONDR_IDSEQ,VM_IDSEQ from
(
 SELECT VM_ID,VM_IDSEQ,name,trim(UPPER(CONCEPT_NAME))CONCEPT_NAME,trim(UPPER(LONG_NAME)) VM_NAME,VM.CONDR_IDSEQ,trim(UPPER(vm.DESCRIPTION)) VM_DESCRIPTION
FROM  SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS VM,
(SELECT M.CONDR_IDSEQ,name, LISTAGG(M.LONG_NAME,' ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY M.ELM_ORDER) as CONCEPT_NAME
FROM  (select CONDR_IDSEQ,name,spl.preferred_name,ELM_ORDER,LONG_NAME
from
(select distinct
 CONDR_IDSEQ,name,
 trim(regexp_substr(name, '[^:]+', 1, levels.column_value)) as preferred_name,levels.column_value ELM_ORDER
from 
 (select *from SBREXT.CON_DERIVATION_RULES_EXT 
 
 where  instr(name,':')>0) t,
 table(cast(multiset(select level from dual connect by level <= length (regexp_replace(t.name, '[^:]+')) + 1) as sys.OdciNumberList))
  levels) spl,
  sbrext.concepts_ext  c
  where spl.preferred_name=c.preferred_name) M
GROUP BY name,M.CONDR_IDSEQ)VW,
 (select count(*),CONDR_IDSEQ from SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS VM 
 where  UPPER(ASL_NAME) not like '%RETIRED%'
 having count(*)>1GROUP BY CONDR_IDSEQ )DR

where    VW.CONDR_IDSEQ=VM.CONDR_IDSEQ
AND  VW.CONDR_IDSEQ=DR.CONDR_IDSEQ
and UPPER(ASL_NAME) not like '%RETIRED%'
and trim(UPPER(VM.LONG_NAME))=trim(UPPER(CONCEPT_NAME))
and instr(NAME,'C45255')=0
 ))
 where FIN_VM=VM_ID
 
 ORDER BY 4,2 desc ;
 
 2.Provide the cient with the List of FINAL and DUP VM with multiple concepts where duplicate VM LONG_NAME<>CONCEPT_NAME.
   then load them to SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF as duplicates.
 3.FIND set of DUP VM where no one VM name =CONCEPT_NAME  (per VW.CONDR_IDSEQ)
 
   After the most current VM (Final VM) found ,they are inserted  to  in the group, the older records inserted in to SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
   with Final VM Public ID and VM_IDSSEQ.


2.duplicate VMs without Concepts (CONDR_IDSEQ is NULL).
  The records in these sets are grouped by VM Long_name and PREFERRED_DEFINITION. 
  After the most current VM (Final VM) found  in the group, the older records inserted in to SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF along 
  with Final VM Public ID(FIN_VM) and VM_IDSSEQ(FIN_IDSEQ).
  
  To avoid insert duplicate records into SBREXT.MDSR_DUP_VM_ERR we delete from found duplicate set of records (A) 
  already existed records in SBREXT.MDSR_DUP_VM_ERR(B) 
  
 Query A. 
   retrieves only records which will be set to retired with final VM record ID.

   select  FIN_VM,vm_id,VM_IDSEQ,CONDR_IDSEQ,CONCEPTS_NAME
   from (
   select max(VM_ID) over  (partition by VM.CONDR_IDSEQ order by VM.CONDR_IDSEQ ) as FIN_VM,VM_ID,VM_IDSEQ,VM.CONDR_IDSEQ,CN.NAME CONCEPTS_NAME
   from 
   SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS VM,
   CON_DERIVATION_RULES_EXT CN
   where   VM.CONDR_IDSEQ=CN.CONDR_IDSEQ
   AND UPPER(ASL_NAME) not like '%RETIRED%'
   AND instr(CN.NAME,'C45255')=0)
   where FIN_VM<>VM_ID 
   
  Query B.
   select  FIN_VM,vm_id,VM_IDSEQ,R.CONDR_IDSEQ,CONCEPTS_NAME 
   from SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF R,
   SBREXT.CON_DERIVATION_RULES_EXT CN
   where R.CONDR_IDSEQ=CN.CONDR_IDSEQ
   AND instr(CN.NAME,'C45255')=0
  
  (A MINUS B) will return duplicate VM records wich are not in SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF yet.
  

  
3.duplicate VMs with Concepts but Concepts Name like "integer".
  The records in these sets are grouped by Concepts Name and Concepts Value. 
  Concepts Name is taken from SBREXT.CON_DERIVATION_RULES_EXT table and Concepts Value from SBREXT.COMPONENT_CONCEPTS_EXT table,
  After the most current VM (Final VM) found  in the group, the older records inserted in to SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
  with Final VM Public ID and VM_IDSSEQ.
  
  Table SBREXT.COMPONENT_CONCEPTS_EXT might have many Concepts Value for one record in SBREXT.CON_DERIVATION_RULES_EXT.
  In order to group records based on Concepts Name and Concepts Value we use aggregated value and instead of table SBREXT.COMPONENT_CONCEPTS
  ,we are using following qoery.
  
  (SELECT CONDR_IDSEQ, LISTAGG(CONCEPT_VALUE,',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY CONCEPT_VALUE) as CONCEPT_VALUE_AG
  FROM  SBREXT.COMPONENT_CONCEPTS_EXT
  where CONCEPT_VALUE is not null
  GROUP BY CONDR_IDSEQ)CC
  
  
 The SP SBREXT.MDSR_CREATE_DUP_VM_DES_DEF is created for:

1.(CURSOR  C1 -final VM and not processed records from duplicate sets).
    a. Set "RELEASED" workflow status for each Final VM.
    b. Add preferred definition with definition type= “Prior preferred definition” – if not in definitions type list. 
 
 2.(CURSOR  C2- not final VM and not processed records from duplicate sets).

     1.Update SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS records found matching in SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF table:
                a. Set "RETIRED ARCHIVED" workflow status.
                b. add to CHANGE_NOTE 'Use VM public ID: FIN_VM Version 1.0 instead. Modified by caDSR script.'
              
     2.Designation is created for each Retired VM for final VM as
              
    3.(CURSOR C_DEF  all DESIGNATIONS for retired VM) 
      DESIGNATIONS are created  for FINAL VM from existing DESIGNATIONS of retired VM if do not exist yet.
      select count(*) into V_cnt
      from SBR.DESIGNATIONS
      where AC_IDSEQ=i.FIN_IDSEQ and CONTE_IDSEQ=n.conte_idseq and trim(upper(NAME))=trim(upper(n.NAME))
      and trim(upper(DETL_NAME))=trim(upper(n.DETL_NAME)) and trim(upper(LAE_NAME))=trim(upper(n.LAE_NAME));
              
    4.(CURSOR C_DES all DEFINITIONS for retired VM) 
      DEFINITIONS are created  for FINAL VM from existing DEFINITIONS of retired VM if do not exist yet.
      select count(*) into V_cnt
      from SBR.DEFINITIONS
      where AC_IDSEQ=i.FIN_IDSEQ and CONTE_IDSEQ=n.conte_idseq 
      and upper(trim(DEFINITION))=upper(trim(n.DEFINITION)) and
      trim(upper(DEFL_NAME))=trim(upper(n.DEFL_NAME)) and trim(upper(LAE_NAME))=trim(upper(n.LAE_NAME));
              
               
 The SP SBREXT.MDSR_CREATE_DUP_VM_CSI is created for:        
 
 1.(CURSOR  C1 -retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS for DESIGNATIONS).
    Create CLASSIFICATIONS of DESIGNATIONS for FINAL VM from retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS of DESIGNATIONS
    avoiding duplicates in CLASSIFICATIONS set.
2.(CURSOR  C2 -retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS for DEFINITIONS).
   Create CLASSIFICATIONS of DEFINITIONS for FINAL VM from retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS of DEFINITIONS
    avoiding duplicates in CLASSIFICATIONS set
              
 The SP SBREXT.MDSR_CHECK_FVM_DES_DEF_CSI is created for:
   1.To check if all DESIGNATIONS where created for FINAL VM  from retired VM DESIGNATIONS
   If any missed, the Procedure  set DES column to 'NC' in SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
   2. To check if all DEFINITIONS where created for FINAL VM  from retired VM DEFINITIONS
   If any missed, the Procedure set DEFN column to 'NC' in SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
   3. To check if all CLASSIFICATIONS of DESIGNATIONS where created for FINAL VM  from retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS of DESIGNATIONS
   If any missed, the Procedure set DES_CL column to 'NC' in SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
   4. To check if all CLASSIFICATIONS of DEFINITIONS where created for FINAL VM  from retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS of DEFINITIONS
    If any missed, the Procedure set DEFN_CL column to 'NC' in SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
   5.When all of 4 columns are NULL then column  PROC='P' .Which means the retired VM record and associated records in SBR.DESIGNATIONS,
   SBR.DEFINITIONS,SBREXT.AC_ATT_CSCSI_EXT tables were added to FINAL VM if not existed.
