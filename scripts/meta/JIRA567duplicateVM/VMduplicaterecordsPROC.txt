The duplicate VMs cleanup process involves insert/modification records in 4 tables:

SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS
SBR.DESIGNATIONS
SBR.DEFINITIONS
SBREXT.AC_ATT_CSCSI_EXT

For the duplicate VMs cleanup process  were created

2 tales in SBREXT schema 
SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
SBREXT.MDSR_DUP_VM_ERR

4 Stored Procedures  in SBREXT schema 
SBREXT.MDSR_CREATE_VM_DUP_REF
SBREXT.MDSR_CRETE_DUP_VM_DES_DEF
SBREXT.MDSR_CREATE_DUP_VM_CSI
SBREXT.MDSR_CHECK_FVM_DES_DEF_CSI


DESCRIPTION 

Table SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF is created as  across reference table between final and retired SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS duplicate records
marked by the duplicate VMs cleanup process.

Table SBREXT.MDSR_DUP_VM_ERR is created to store reasons of failures of the process.

The SP SBREXT.MDSR_CREATE_VM_DUP_REF finds 3 goup of sets of VM duplicate records.

1.duplicate VMs without Concepts (CONDR_IDSEQ is NULL).
  The records in these sets are grouped by VM Long_name and PREFERRED_DEFINITION. 
  After the most current VM (Final VM) found  in the goup,the older records inserted in to SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF alohg 
  with Final VM Public ID(FIN_VM) and VM_IDSSEQ(FIN_IDSEQ).
2.duplicate VMs with Concepts but Concepts Name(CONDR_IDSEQ is NOT NULL) not like "integer".
   The records in these sets are grouped by VM CONDR_IDSEQ. 
  After the most current VM (Final VM) found  in the goup,the older records inserted in to SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
  with Final VM Public ID and VM_IDSSEQ.
3.duplicate VMs with Concepts but Concepts Name like "integer".
  The records in these sets are grouped by Concepts Name and Concepts Value. 
  Concepts Name is taken from SBREXT.CON_DERIVATION_RULES_EXT table and Concepts Value fromSBREXT.COMPONENT_CONCEPTS_EXT table,
  After the most current VM (Final VM) found  in the goup,the older records inserted in to SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF
  with Final VM Public ID and VM_IDSSEQ.
  
  
 The SP SBREXT.MDSR_CRETE_DUP_VM_DES_DEF is created for:
 
 1.(CURSOR  C1 -final VM and not processed records from duplicate sets).
    a.Set "RELEASED" workflow status for each Final VM.
    b.Add preferred definition with definition type= “Prior preferred definition” – if not in definitions type list. 
 
 2.(CURSOR  C2- not final VM and not processed records from duplicate sets).
 
    1.Update SBR.VALUE_MEANINGS records found matching in SBREXT.MDSR_VM_DUP_REF table:
	  a.Set "RETIRED ARCHIVED" workflow status.
	  b.add to CHANGE_NOTE 'Use VM public ID: FIN_VM Version 1.0 instead. Modified by caDSR script.'
	
	2.Designation is created for each Retired VM for final VM as
	
    3.(CURSOR C_DEF  all DESIGNATIONS for retired VM) 
	 DESIGNATIONS are created  for FINAL VM from existing DESIGNATIONS of retired VM if do not exist yet.
	 select count(*) into V_cnt
     from SBR.DESIGNATIONS
     where AC_IDSEQ=i.FIN_IDSEQ and CONTE_IDSEQ=n.conte_idseq and trim(upper(NAME))=trim(upper(n.NAME))
     and trim(upper(DETL_NAME))=trim(upper(n.DETL_NAME)) and trim(upper(LAE_NAME))=trim(upper(n.LAE_NAME));
	 
	4.(CURSOR C_DES all DEFINITIONS for retired VM) 
	 DEFINITIONS are created  for FINAL VM from existing DEFINITIONS of retired VM if do not exist yet.
	 select count(*) into V_cnt
     from SBR.DEFINITIONS
     where AC_IDSEQ=i.FIN_IDSEQ and CONTE_IDSEQ=n.conte_idseq 
     and upper(trim(DEFINITION))=upper(trim(n.DEFINITION)) and
     trim(upper(DEFL_NAME))=trim(upper(n.DEFL_NAME)) and trim(upper(LAE_NAME))=trim(upper(n.LAE_NAME));
	 
	 
 The SP SBREXT.MDSR_CREATE_DUP_VM_CSI is created for:	 
 
 1.(CURSOR  C1 -retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS for DESIGNATIONS).
    Create CLASSIFICATIONS of DESIGNATIONS for FINAL VM from retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS of DESIGNATIONS
	avoiding duplicates in CLASSIFICATIONS set.
 2.(CURSOR  C2 -retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS for DEFINITIONS).
    Create CLASSIFICATIONS of DEFINITIONS for FINAL VM from retired VM CLASSIFICATIONS of DEFINITIONS
	avoiding duplicates in CLASSIFICATIONS set
	
 The SP SBREXT.MDSR_CHECK_FVM_DES_DEF_CSI is created for:
