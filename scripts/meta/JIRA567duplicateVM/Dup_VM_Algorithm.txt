Current Algorithm of identifying Final and duplicate VMs(for not integers CDR):
 There are 3 group of duplicate sets of not RETIRED VMs:
 1. When find VM with long name =Concept name in duplicate set.
 2. When not find VM with long name =Concept name in duplicate set, but find VM long name = Synonym name 
 3. When not find VM with long name =Concept name or VM long name = Synonym name in duplicate set.

 Final VM was id entified from the set of VM with the same Concept Derivation Rule ID (CDRI):
 1.When Final VM long name =Concept name and is most current VM .
 Duplicate VMs for this CDRI can have Long name =Concept name or Synonym
 2.When Final VM long name = Synonym name and is most current VM (No VM long name =Concept name in find duplicate set of VMs).
 Duplicate VMs for this CDRI can have Long name = Final VM long name or other Synonym
 3.When No VM long name =Concept or other Synonym name in find duplicate set of VMs( per Concept Derivation Rule ID)
 Final VM is most current VM per Concept Derivation Rule ID.
 Duplicate VMs for this CDRI have same Long name as Final VM.
